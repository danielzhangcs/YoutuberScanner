He pulled a piece of PVC pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could make a project with it. A blowgun was the first idea that came to mind, and quickly snowballed into a really awesome project idea!\n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nThis is an original project idea which came right out of the blue a couple of weeks ago, but is among my favorites already!\n\nThe blowgun is so simple and cheap to make, anyone can do it, and the best part is it looks completely legit, and can fire with amazing precision.\n\nWhen my 5 year old son pulled a piece of plastic pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could do a project I immediately thought of making a blow dart gun. But to make it safer for indoor use, I tried using paper for ammunition. I rolled up a post-it note, and shoved the tip of a crayon inside to add some weight.\n\nWhen we shot the dart, it flew over 100 feet away at high velocity, making me realize there is a real project here waiting to be developed.\n\nI spent the next 5 days evolving different prototypes, and experimenting with different types of homemade ammunition.\n\nI let my kids try shooting darts made with nails, but their lungs weren't powerful enough to get the darts to stick into targets, so we use marshmallows instead. The pipe is the perfect width for mini-marshmallows and can still shoot them fast enough to hurt a little, but still safe enough for indoor use.\n\nThe blowguns can be customized with different color schemes in a way that's so simple it's nearly mind blowing.\n\nMany people have asked how to make the precision laser sight. It's just a 2\" piece of the same PVC pipe, with 8 screws, as seen in the video. Simply insert the laser, and adjust the screws until the laser is pointing directly at the place where the blowgun hits the target, then make sure the screws are relatively tight so the laser doesn't move.\u00a0\n\nHave fun and good luck! It's mind-blowing to think this stuff is in our food!  Here's how to make a glowing \"magical mud\" from ordinary potatoes.\n\nBecause of the popularity of this project, I've put together a detailed 15 page PDF ( with step-by-step instructions, Fun Facts, Helpful Hints, and loaded with pictures.  I'm selling them to help compensate for my time.

They peeled some potatoes to make us dinner, and I noticed the white residue at the bottom of the dish and asked if I could take it home.\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nWhen I realized that potatoes could be chopped up and soaked to leach out the starch, of course the first thing I thought of was making oobleck.  My mind was blown when I experimented with this process, and realized the starch would collect at the bottom of the dish, and would stay in place when the water and impurities were poured out.\n\nAfter only a couple of rinses, it's amazing to see how pure the starch powder can be.  It looks exactly like cornstarch that could be purchased at the store.\n\nI was familiar with the idea of making tonic water glow under UV light, so wondered how it would would mix with the starch powder.  The result was very gratifying! Call them Yoshi eggs, Stress-balls, or Ninja Turtle squishies.

I wasn\u2019t willing to pay $10 for a bag of 3, so I went home and played around with different methods until I figured out how to make these with balloons and flour.\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nMy kids go crazy playing with these little toys because they are soft, squishy, and very colorful.  What\u2019s really cool about them is that we can make them together, and they don\u2019t cost very much at all.  In-fact, they end up just costing pennies a piece.\n\nThey make cool gifts for birthday parties, and I personally use them for juggling balls from time to time, because they are perfectly weighted, and have a soft and rubbery grip. How to make rockets that shoot over 40 feet, with aluminum foil and a match.\n\nSome quick links to a few of the materials I used:\n\n[\u2713] Safety Matches: \n[\u2713] Aluminum Foil: \n[\u2713] Tea Light Candles: \n[\u2713] Bamboo Skewers: \n\nBecause of the popularity of this project, I've put together a detailed 28 page PDF ( with step-by-step instructions, Fun Facts, Helpful Hints, and loaded with pictures.

Misuse, or careless use, may result in property damage. Use of this video content is at your own risk.\n\nMusic By: Scott & Brendo (\u201cFire\u201d - Instrumental) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nA video by Marek Hayward I saw over a year ago.  ( If you check out the link, please share the love and let Marek know that Grant Thompson sent you. :)  Thank you!\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nAfter seeing the video by Marek Hayward (which had 10,000 views at the time, and is now over 1,000,000!) I dropped everything I was doing to try this experiment.\n\nUnfortunately I couldn\u2019t get much success with it.  The rockets only seemed to work about half the time, and the needle they were launching from would get coated in carbon and tar residues after only a couple of launches, which seriously affected the performance.\n\nIn addition, the rockets weren\u2019t balanced, so once they fired, they wouldn\u2019t shoot very straight.\n\nIt\u2019s taken me over a year of prototyping and testing, and playing with different ideas to get the result you see in this video.  I developed the idea into a full-on matchbox rocket launching kit, which I\u2019m super proud of, and excited to share in the project video.\n\nThese rockets shoot consistently between 20-40 feet, and one of the biggest factors to whether the rockets work or fail, depends on how tight the crimp is on the rockets nose.  Any rocket that has failed on me has almost always been because the crimp wasn\u2019t done right, or wasn\u2019t tight enough.\n\nThe rockets will propel the furthest if they're launched from a stable base that has little to no give.  If there is any give on the launchpad, that will absorb some of the energy and the rocket won\u2019t go as far.\n\nMultiple tests in my house confirmed that if the rockets land on the carpet, they need to be moved within 1-2 seconds, or they will begin to melt into the fabric.  The aluminum casings are heated in a flame until they reach the auto-ignition temperature of the match head, so you can expect them to be very hot, and may want to be wearing gloves when you recover the spent rocket casings as well :)\n\nThis is an awesome and exciting project whether you're a kid or and adult.  It\u2019s impressive to fire a rocket with one match head and see such power, and the smoke trail it leaves in it\u2019s wake is extremely satisfying as well.\n\nI\u2019m giving away the template I made for free, all I ask in return is that you please share this video :)  You can get it here:  Check out our LIQUID METAL fidget spinner video:  \n\nBottles of Water: \nFood Coloring: \nFoil Pan: \nInflatable Duck: \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nDry-Ice Cream: \n5 Tricks With Dry Ice: \nBuying Liquid Nitrogen: \nNitrocellulose Lacquer: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nMusic by: Johan Borjesson - \"All Of Us\"\nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound: \n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

It feels so good on the teeth to bite into it, and my kids go crazy for them .. so I spent a bit of time researching how they're made commercially.\n\nMy biggest motivation for doing this was to see if we could make our own at home, and I'm actually still trying to figure out how to make gelatin and corn syrup from scratch, so if I can figure out how to do that, maybe I'll show how to do it in another project video.\n\nOnly a small handful of you have ever seen the LEGO Gummy video I made in 2010, and that's because it was nearly 5 years ago, before I really got serious about making videos.  I took it off my channel in 2012 because I had full intentions of making a better version, so here it is .. 3 years later! :)\n\nNow I wanted to make candies that made people look twice, and LEGO bricks instantly came to mind because what's more awesome than LEGO and gummy put together?  But I wasn't sure where could you get a mold for making LEGO bricks.\n\nSurfing around the internet, I stumbled across an awesome Instructable by SFHandyman: \n\nTo my amazement, not only had he shown how to make a mold for making LEGO candy, he also made LEGO gummies as well!  \n\nI played around with loads of variations in recipes to see what texture and tastes I liked the best.  And I've kept experimenting off and on for the last 4 years, using my kids and wife for feedback.  They gobble them up no matter what variations I use, but I've finally settled on 1/2 cup of very cold water, 1/4 cup of corn syrup, 2 packets of unflavored gelatin, and 1 pack of Jell-O.  I've found that the corn syrup seems to help smooth out the texture and the taste.\n\nIf you try making this recipe, it's very important to start the gelatin in cold water.  Stir it up, then let it sit for 5 minutes before you turn on the heat.  Otherwise, you'll get gobby clumps of undissolved gelatin in your syrup that doesn't look very appetizing.  \n\nI originally made my silicone mold with a 2 part mix from a special effects supply company.  I used real LEGO bricks set on a LEGO base, and built a makeshift retaining wall with bricks and play-dough.  I don't plan to make a tutorial on how to make the mold, but I want to do a video on how to make a silicone mold in general.  It's amazing to see how much detail the silicone can transfer to the final gummy products.  If you look closely at my candies you can even see the little \u201cLEGO\u201d text on top of the gummy LEGO studs.\n\nTo make sour gummies, we often add citric acid.  They are incredible!  But if you don't have citric acid, try taking SFHandyman's suggestion and add vitamin C.  The citric and ascorbic acids in the vitamins sour them the same way, which actually makes them taste just as great, and enriches them with vitamin C as well. Gummy Chicken Reveal!

It's amazing to see how much detail the silicone can transfer to the final gummy products.  If you look closely at my candies you can even see the little \u201cLEGO\u201d text on top of the gummy LEGO studs.\n\nTo make sour gummies, we often add citric acid.  They are incredible!  But if you don't have citric acid, try taking SFHandyman's suggestion and add vitamin C.  The citric and ascorbic acids in the vitamins sour them the same way, which actually makes them taste just as great, and enriches them with vitamin C as well. Take any bottle of soda, and get it to freeze on command! This \u201csuper cool\" trick works with cans of soda as well. \n\nSome quick links to a few of the materials I used:\n\n[\u2713] Coke: \n[\u2713] Quaich (little silver dish from Scotland) :\n\nTo date, I haven't seen any tutorials on exactly how to get this \"self-freezing coke\" effect, so I'm excited to release this video in response to thousands of viewer requests.\n\nCheck out the 42 second version: (QC#13 - Instant Slushy!) \n\nTry this trick with water (Waterbending In Real Life): \nDetailed Tips & Tricks for making \"Instant Ice\": \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nWaterbending: \nPower Of The Sun: \nDry-Ice Cream: \nMaking Butter: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nTwitter: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING: \n\nLeaving soda in the freezer too long can result in failure of the container, and a big mess. Glass bottles are not recommended, as the ice expands when freezing and can shatter the glass explosively. Use of video content is at own risk. \n\nMusic By:  (Remember The Dreams) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nThe viral YouTube video: \"How to Chill A Coke In just a second!!\" ( and the process of nucleation was inspired by \"Self-Freezing Coke - Crazy from Kong!\"  \n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nI knew water could be turned to instant ice ( but was amazed to see that soda could be supercooled as well.\n\nThe anomaly of \"self freezing soda\" has been observed by many people, usually by accident. Some people put a soda in the freezer to chill it, but then forget about it. When they've remembered and gone to get it, it's liquid until they open it, leaving them puzzled. Some people have noticed the effect by leaving the soda outside in cold temperatures.\n\nThere is a vending machine in Hong Kong that sells supercooled Coke bottles, and the instructions to trigger nucleation is the same as in this video, however they recommend taking a sip when the cap is on. I believe this is to increase the chances of impurities being introduced into the liquid, making nucleation more likely. \n\nFrom what I've seen, the results in this experiment form an even thicker slush than the vending machine in Hong Kong.\n\nTo get this effect, I put 4 bottles of 500mL (16.9 oz) soda in a freezer set at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) between 3:15- 4:00 hours. The longer they are in, the more dramatic and solid the slushy freeze will be. However, anytime after 3:15 hours there is a chance of them freezing before you take them out.\n\nEvery freezer will be a little different temperature, and I've noticed the location of your bottles in the freezer makes a dramatic difference on freeze times. For best results, choose one consistent location in your freezer, and play around with freeze times to see what works best for you. In my freezer, the middle of the center rack settles at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) and takes 3:15 to super chill 4 bottles.\n\nRemember that the longer the freezer door is open, the more cold air will escape, and it will make your freeze times take much longer because your freezer has to cool down again. I've also noticed that the more frozen items you have in your freezer, the faster your soda will chill. In contrast, the less items in your freezer, the longer your soda will take to cool. Bottom line is, use a consistent environment for your experiments, and you'll get consistent results!\n\nI also experimented with 2 litter bottles, and had great results between 4-5 hours. The whole bottle slushifies in an instant. \n\nI experimented with Gatorade, Fresca, Mexican Sprite, Rootbeer, Orange sodas, Coke, Diet Coke, in bottle form, as well as in cans. I had super cooled success with them all!\n\nThe trick to getting the 3 second slush, is quickly releasing the pressure in the bottle and re-securing the cap, flipping the bottle upside down, and back upright again. This is because the forming ice crystals will be moved around the length of the bottle, and trigger nucleation for the rest of the soda.\n\nIf you were to just take the cap off, ice will form, and it will slowly spread downward, but might take upwards of 2 minutes for the bottle to completely freeze.\n\nRemoving the pressure very slowly from the bottle, can keep the soda liquified, and give you the choice opportunity to play with supercooled soda outside of the bottle. If you're not a coconut cracking ninja from Samoa, then you'll need an easier way to bust coconuts for pleasure, or for survival.  This is the easiest and most effective way I've found to do it, when you don't have any tools.\n\nInspired by Tom Hanks \"Castaway\".

He pulled a piece of PVC pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could make a project with it. A blowgun was the first idea that came to mind, and quickly snowballed into a really awesome project idea!\n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nThis is an original project idea which came right out of the blue a couple of weeks ago, but is among my favorites already!\n\nThe blowgun is so simple and cheap to make, anyone can do it, and the best part is it looks completely legit, and can fire with amazing precision.\n\nWhen my 5 year old son pulled a piece of plastic pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could do a project I immediately thought of making a blow dart gun. But to make it safer for indoor use, I tried using paper for ammunition. I rolled up a post-it note, and shoved the tip of a crayon inside to add some weight.\n\nWhen we shot the dart, it flew over 100 feet away at high velocity, making me realize there is a real project here waiting to be developed.\n\nI spent the next 5 days evolving different prototypes, and experimenting with different types of homemade ammunition.\n\nI let my kids try shooting darts made with nails, but their lungs weren't powerful enough to get the darts to stick into targets, so we use marshmallows instead. The pipe is the perfect width for mini-marshmallows and can still shoot them fast enough to hurt a little, but still safe enough for indoor use.\n\nThe blowguns can be customized with different color schemes in a way that's so simple it's nearly mind blowing.\n\nMany people have asked how to make the precision laser sight. It's just a 2\" piece of the same PVC pipe, with 8 screws, as seen in the video. Simply insert the laser, and adjust the screws until the laser is pointing directly at the place where the blowgun hits the target, then make sure the screws are relatively tight so the laser doesn't move.\u00a0\n\nHave fun and good luck! It's mind-blowing to think this stuff is in our food!

Borax also is known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate or disodium tetraborate.\n\nIf you don't have access to Borax, I've heard that liquid starch can be used instead.

This \u201csuper cool\" trick works with cans of soda as well. \n\nSome quick links to a few of the materials I used:\n\n[\u2713] Coke: \n[\u2713] Quaich (little silver dish from Scotland) :\n\nTo date, I haven't seen any tutorials on exactly how to get this \"self-freezing coke\" effect, so I'm excited to release this video in response to thousands of viewer requests.\n\nCheck out the 42 second version: (QC#13 - Instant Slushy!) \n\nTry this trick with water (Waterbending In Real Life): \nDetailed Tips & Tricks for making \"Instant Ice\": \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nWaterbending: \nPower Of The Sun: \nDry-Ice Cream: \nMaking Butter: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nTwitter: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING: \n\nLeaving soda in the freezer too long can result in failure of the container, and a big mess. Glass bottles are not recommended, as the ice expands when freezing and can shatter the glass explosively. Use of video content is at own risk. \n\nMusic By:  (Remember The Dreams) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nThe viral YouTube video: \"How to Chill A Coke In just a second!!\" ( and the process of nucleation was inspired by \"Self-Freezing Coke - Crazy from Kong!\"  \n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nI knew water could be turned to instant ice ( but was amazed to see that soda could be supercooled as well.\n\nThe anomaly of \"self freezing soda\" has been observed by many people, usually by accident. Some people put a soda in the freezer to chill it, but then forget about it. When they've remembered and gone to get it, it's liquid until they open it, leaving them puzzled. Some people have noticed the effect by leaving the soda outside in cold temperatures.\n\nThere is a vending machine in Hong Kong that sells supercooled Coke bottles, and the instructions to trigger nucleation is the same as in this video, however they recommend taking a sip when the cap is on. I believe this is to increase the chances of impurities being introduced into the liquid, making nucleation more likely. \n\nFrom what I've seen, the results in this experiment form an even thicker slush than the vending machine in Hong Kong.\n\nTo get this effect, I put 4 bottles of 500mL (16.9 oz) soda in a freezer set at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) between 3:15- 4:00 hours. The longer they are in, the more dramatic and solid the slushy freeze will be. However, anytime after 3:15 hours there is a chance of them freezing before you take them out.\n\nEvery freezer will be a little different temperature, and I've noticed the location of your bottles in the freezer makes a dramatic difference on freeze times. For best results, choose one consistent location in your freezer, and play around with freeze times to see what works best for you. In my freezer, the middle of the center rack settles at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) and takes 3:15 to super chill 4 bottles.\n\nRemember that the longer the freezer door is open, the more cold air will escape, and it will make your freeze times take much longer because your freezer has to cool down again. I've also noticed that the more frozen items you have in your freezer, the faster your soda will chill. In contrast, the less items in your freezer, the longer your soda will take to cool. Bottom line is, use a consistent environment for your experiments, and you'll get consistent results!\n\nI also experimented with 2 litter bottles, and had great results between 4-5 hours. The whole bottle slushifies in an instant. \n\nI experimented with Gatorade, Fresca, Mexican Sprite, Rootbeer, Orange sodas, Coke, Diet Coke, in bottle form, as well as in cans. I had super cooled success with them all!\n\nThe trick to getting the 3 second slush, is quickly releasing the pressure in the bottle and re-securing the cap, flipping the bottle upside down, and back upright again. This is because the forming ice crystals will be moved around the length of the bottle, and trigger nucleation for the rest of the soda.\n\nIf you were to just take the cap off, ice will form, and it will slowly spread downward, but might take upwards of 2 minutes for the bottle to completely freeze.\n\nRemoving the pressure very slowly from the bottle, can keep the soda liquified, and give you the choice opportunity to play with supercooled soda outside of the bottle.  If you're not a coconut cracking ninja from Samoa, then you'll need an easier way to bust coconuts for pleasure, or for survival.  This is the easiest and most effective way I've found to do it, when you don't have any tools.\n\nInspired by Tom Hanks \"Castaway\".

So I asked Ritchie if he could help me engineer a sugar rocket.\n\nMost rocket clubs won't let you fly sugar motors, except on special experimental launch days.

In the future I'll probably try using colored electrical tape, a bit of duck-tape, or another flexible rubber tape with more adhesion for better durability.\n\nEither way, they are super easy to fix if they come apart.  All you have to do is tape them back together! :)\n\nHave fun!

But at about 64\u00a2 per launch just for the wadding, it seems to burn a hole in your hobby rocket money instead.\n\nI understood that recovery wadding was necessary, but it amazed me at how expensive the wadding was, and made me wonder if there was a cheaper alternative.\n\nI read a few articles suggesting that items like baking soda, roach killer, washing soda, etc could all work as makeshift flame retarders, so I began experimenting with all of them.\n\nOver the course of a month, I tested various recipes of the different powders dissolved in water by themselves, and combinations of the powders mixed in water as well.  Some worked better than others, and in the end I decided just to keep it simple by sticking to baking soda.\n\nBaking soda is a common household item, and when it gets heated up, it releases CO2 gas, which suppresses fires.  \n\nI found that about 1 Teaspoon of baking soda dissolved in about \u00bc cup of room temperature water made a saturated solution, and if I soaked a paper towel in the solution and let it dry out, the treated paper wouldn't be able to catch fire anymore.\n\nI did notice that in every test I did, the paper would smolder as long as it had access to air though, so there is still some risk of a fire hazard if left to smolder in a warm dry place with combustable materials nearby.  But in all my testing, the paper didn't even scorch when the ejection charges went off.\n\nSurprisingly, when I tested a sheet of the expensive commercial recovery wadding, the whole thing went up in flames in a matter of seconds.  That blew my mind, and made me wonder what justified charging such a high premium for it.\n\nIn further experimenting, I verified that using crepe paper from the dollar store (the streamers you hang from the ceiling for parties) is extremely fire resistant as well.  Just double-check the label to make sure it's marked as fire resistant on the package.  So far it's actually been the most flame retarding wadding I've ever used.\n\nCrepe paper is extremely cheap (2 rolls for $1), but you have to use more of it to make sure your parachute is protected.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that the baking soda and water solution is the most practical and economical option for the average hobbyist.  You can make as much rocket wadding as you want, and it pro-rates out to about 0.025 per sheet, making it about 300 times cheaper than the name brand stuff.\n\nRitchie and I have tested this wadding over and over and over again with rocket launch after rocket launch, and in every case it's held up better than the commercial wadding, and doesn't even scorch on ejection charges from Estes black powder motors, or my homemade Sugar Rockets.\n\nThe best part about using baking soda as a flame retardant, is it's completely non-toxic, edible, and bio-degradable.

In my opinion, it's the best way to learn about how rocketry really works. \n\nThis project was inspired by my good friend \"Ritchie\".  \n\nWe collaborated on a design for the \"Randomizer Rocket\", which you should have seen making a cameo in this video, if you were paying attention.\n\nWhen it was time to go film the launches we knew we had to make a custom launch pad.  We needed something that would swivel 360\u00ba, and support the launch of the Randomizer.\n\nI didn't have much time to put into the creative efforts for designing a launch pad, but once again, Ritchie went home that same day and whipped up a design that I really liked, which you can see here: (\n\nHis design uses 1/2\" PVC, and originally used a paint can lid for the blast pad, which we quickly discovered didn't hold up very well to repeated blasts of rocket fuel.\n\nI still really liked the idea of using a pot lid from a thrift store as a blast pad, like I showed in the \"Redneck Rocketry\" video: ( so I kept that, and upgraded the launch frame to 3/4\" PVC as well.\n\nI slightly modified the paint job, but all-in -all this idea was heavily founded on Ritchie's idea, so big shout-out to him for giving approval to make my own version, and my own project video.\n\nYou can see the launch-pad angles to any position you could ever hope for, and is sturdy and durable enough to take a beating from multiple launches, with hardly any sign of wear.\n\nI'm really excited to have the Randomizer Blast-Pad join me as an important addition to this series on home-built rocketry.\n\nDepending on whether you already have PVC glue and spray paint, you can probably get away with making the launch pad for around $10.\n\nBy the way, I keep the launch-pad behind my workstation, so every now and then you might catch a glimpse of it in the background of random project videos.

It feels so good on the teeth to bite into it, and my kids go crazy for them .. so I spent a bit of time researching how they're made commercially.\n\nMy biggest motivation for doing this was to see if we could make our own at home, and I'm actually still trying to figure out how to make gelatin and corn syrup from scratch, so if I can figure out how to do that, maybe I'll show how to do it in another project video.\n\nOnly a small handful of you have ever seen the LEGO Gummy video I made in 2010, and that's because it was nearly 5 years ago, before I really got serious about making videos.  I took it off my channel in 2012 because I had full intentions of making a better version, so here it is .. 3 years later! :)\n\nNow I wanted to make candies that made people look twice, and LEGO bricks instantly came to mind because what's more awesome than LEGO and gummy put together?  But I wasn't sure where could you get a mold for making LEGO bricks.\n\nSurfing around the internet, I stumbled across an awesome Instructable by SFHandyman: \n\nTo my amazement, not only had he shown how to make a mold for making LEGO candy, he also made LEGO gummies as well!  \n\nI played around with loads of variations in recipes to see what texture and tastes I liked the best.  And I've kept experimenting off and on for the last 4 years, using my kids and wife for feedback.  They gobble them up no matter what variations I use, but I've finally settled on 1/2 cup of very cold water, 1/4 cup of corn syrup, 2 packets of unflavored gelatin, and 1 pack of Jell-O.  I've found that the corn syrup seems to help smooth out the texture and the taste.\n\nIf you try making this recipe, it's very important to start the gelatin in cold water.  Stir it up, then let it sit for 5 minutes before you turn on the heat.  Otherwise, you'll get gobby clumps of undissolved gelatin in your syrup that doesn't look very appetizing.  \n\nI originally made my silicone mold with a 2 part mix from a special effects supply company.  I used real LEGO bricks set on a LEGO base, and built a makeshift retaining wall with bricks and play-dough.  I don't plan to make a tutorial on how to make the mold, but I want to do a video on how to make a silicone mold in general.  It's amazing to see how much detail the silicone can transfer to the final gummy products.  If you look closely at my candies you can even see the little \u201cLEGO\u201d text on top of the gummy LEGO studs.\n\nTo make sour gummies, we often add citric acid.  They are incredible!  But if you don't have citric acid, try taking SFHandyman's suggestion and add vitamin C.  The citric and ascorbic acids in the vitamins sour them the same way, which actually makes them taste just as great, and enriches them with vitamin C as well. Take any bottle of soda, and get it to freeze on command! This \u201csuper cool\" trick works with cans of soda as well. \n\nSome quick links to a few of the materials I used:\n\n[\u2713] Coke: \n[\u2713] Quaich (little silver dish from Scotland) :\n\nTo date, I haven't seen any tutorials on exactly how to get this \"self-freezing coke\" effect, so I'm excited to release this video in response to thousands of viewer requests.\n\nCheck out the 42 second version: (QC#13 - Instant Slushy!) \n\nTry this trick with water (Waterbending In Real Life): \nDetailed Tips & Tricks for making \"Instant Ice\": \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nWaterbending: \nPower Of The Sun: \nDry-Ice Cream: \nMaking Butter: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nTwitter: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING: \n\nLeaving soda in the freezer too long can result in failure of the container, and a big mess. Glass bottles are not recommended, as the ice expands when freezing and can shatter the glass explosively. Use of video content is at own risk. \n\nMusic By:  (Remember The Dreams) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nThe viral YouTube video: \"How to Chill A Coke In just a second!!\" ( and the process of nucleation was inspired by \"Self-Freezing Coke - Crazy from Kong!\"  \n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nI knew water could be turned to instant ice ( but was amazed to see that soda could be supercooled as well.\n\nThe anomaly of \"self freezing soda\" has been observed by many people, usually by accident. Some people put a soda in the freezer to chill it, but then forget about it. When they've remembered and gone to get it, it's liquid until they open it, leaving them puzzled. Some people have noticed the effect by leaving the soda outside in cold temperatures.\n\nThere is a vending machine in Hong Kong that sells supercooled Coke bottles, and the instructions to trigger nucleation is the same as in this video, however they recommend taking a sip when the cap is on. I believe this is to increase the chances of impurities being introduced into the liquid, making nucleation more likely. \n\nFrom what I've seen, the results in this experiment form an even thicker slush than the vending machine in Hong Kong.\n\nTo get this effect, I put 4 bottles of 500mL (16.9 oz) soda in a freezer set at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) between 3:15- 4:00 hours. The longer they are in, the more dramatic and solid the slushy freeze will be. However, anytime after 3:15 hours there is a chance of them freezing before you take them out.\n\nEvery freezer will be a little different temperature, and I've noticed the location of your bottles in the freezer makes a dramatic difference on freeze times. For best results, choose one consistent location in your freezer, and play around with freeze times to see what works best for you. In my freezer, the middle of the center rack settles at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) and takes 3:15 to super chill 4 bottles.\n\nRemember that the longer the freezer door is open, the more cold air will escape, and it will make your freeze times take much longer because your freezer has to cool down again. I've also noticed that the more frozen items you have in your freezer, the faster your soda will chill. In contrast, the less items in your freezer, the longer your soda will take to cool. Bottom line is, use a consistent environment for your experiments, and you'll get consistent results!\n\nI also experimented with 2 litter bottles, and had great results between 4-5 hours. The whole bottle slushifies in an instant. \n\nI experimented with Gatorade, Fresca, Mexican Sprite, Rootbeer, Orange sodas, Coke, Diet Coke, in bottle form, as well as in cans. I had super cooled success with them all!\n\nThe trick to getting the 3 second slush, is quickly releasing the pressure in the bottle and re-securing the cap, flipping the bottle upside down, and back upright again. This is because the forming ice crystals will be moved around the length of the bottle, and trigger nucleation for the rest of the soda.\n\nIf you were to just take the cap off, ice will form, and it will slowly spread downward, but might take upwards of 2 minutes for the bottle to completely freeze.\n\nRemoving the pressure very slowly from the bottle, can keep the soda liquified, and give you the choice opportunity to play with supercooled soda outside of the bottle. If you're not a coconut cracking ninja from Samoa, then you'll need an easier way to bust coconuts for pleasure, or for survival.  This is the easiest and most effective way I've found to do it, when you don't have any tools.\n\nInspired by Tom Hanks \"Castaway\".

They peeled some potatoes to make us dinner, and I noticed the white residue at the bottom of the dish and asked if I could take it home.\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nWhen I realized that potatoes could be chopped up and soaked to leach out the starch, of course the first thing I thought of was making oobleck.  My mind was blown when I experimented with this process, and realized the starch would collect at the bottom of the dish, and would stay in place when the water and impurities were poured out.\n\nAfter only a couple of rinses, it's amazing to see how pure the starch powder can be.  It looks exactly like cornstarch that could be purchased at the store.\n\nI was familiar with the idea of making tonic water glow under UV light, so wondered how it would would mix with the starch powder.  The result was very gratifying! Do you have trouble falling asleep? Do you toss and turn at night? A good night\u2019s sleep is necessary for optimal health. So if you\u2019re one of the millions of people in the world who suffers from a sleep disorder or you want to fall asleep faster, watch this video to learn a trick straight from the US military. \n\nThe amount of sleep a person needs depends greatly on their age. Knowing how much you should be sleeping can help you figure out if your sleep routine works or if it needs tweaking.

It\u2019s estimated that around 20% of people worldwide suffer from sleep deprivation.\n- Insomnia can be common if people are under a great amount of stress, experiencing big life changes, or having emotional difficulties.\n- If you suffer from insomnia, a lack of sleep can cause hormonal imbalances, which lead to weight gain, slower reaction times, irritability, memory problems, depression, and headaches.\n- Lie face up in bed. Relax your facial muscles, including your tongue, jaw, and the muscles around your eyes. If you realize you have a frown, really focus on releasing the area in the center of your forehead.\n- Drop your shoulders as low as possible. This will also help you stretch and release the tension in your neck. Then relax your upper and lower arm on one side, and then try it with the other arm.\n- Breathe out, and relax your chest. Feel your lungs fill up with air. \n- Relax your legs. Release the tension from your thighs first, and then let the relaxation travel down to your calves. Finally, focus on your feet and ankles. \n- Now that the muscles in your body are relaxed, it\u2019s time to clear your mind completely. \n- When the pilots were trained in this exercise, they performed it sitting down on a chair. In those exercises, they put their feet flat on the floor, placed their hands on their laps, and let them go limp.\n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\n\nFacebook: \nInstagram: \n\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\n  How to recycle scrap metal in the backyard, with a homemade, Mini Metal Foundry.\n\nCommon materials in the Mini Metal Foundry\n\n[\u2713] Clay Graphite Crucible: \n[\u2713] Steel Pail: \n[\u2713] Plaster of Paris: \n[\u2713] 2.5 Quart Bucket: \n[\u2713] 5 Quart Big Mouth Bucket: \n[\u2713] Heat Resistant Gloves: \n[\u2713] 1-3/8\u201d Hole Saw: \n[\u2713] 3\u201d Hole Saw: \n[\u2713] 1\u201d x 12\u201d Steel Pipe: \n\nGet \"The Hobbit\"  - Win the sword: \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nMini Fire Logs: \nMatchstick Gun: \n5 Crazy Science Stunts: \nGravity Puzzle: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING:  Charcoal foundries can reach temperatures in excess of 1,000\u00baC, which is well above the melting point of hobbyists.

The functionality is founded on ideas I collected while searching the internet for foundry designs.\n\nBackground: \n\nFor as long as I can remember, I've been intrigued by the idea of melting metal and making things with it.  The problem has always been that it was out of reach or required really expensive equipment.\n\nIn this project I experimented with 10 different prototypes, to develop a reusable backyard foundry that melts aluminum soda cans easily and safely.  I tested different refractory recipes, different containers, different setting for blowing air, and different types of makeshift crucibles.\n\nI tried various ratios of portland cement, sand, perlite, plaster of paris, water, and even kitty litter.  For containers, I experimented with clay pots, plastic buckets, no container, cinderblocks, and a galvanized steel pail.\n\nI ended up favoring the galvanized steel pail, and a mix of 50% plaster of paris, and 50% play sand, by volume, which was inspired by a video by NightHawkInLight \"How to Make a Soup Can Forge\" \n\nDepending on where you get, or find, your materials the cost can range anywhere from $5-$25 per unit.  With the materials I used, I was able to make 2 units for under $40 ($20 each).  Even on the high end, this is probably one of the cheapest, reliable, backyard foundries that can be made.\n\nI used mine to melt soda cans, and extract the aluminum for future metal casting projects.  All the soda cans came from a local recycling depot.  I bought back 30 lbs from the depot to avoid having to drink gallons and gallons of soda.  :)  I stored the ingots in various forms, which you can see in the next video, and tried a cool technique for making a little sword by pouring liquid metal into a bucket of sand.  I'm planning to make a project video on how to do that in the near future. \n\nThanks for watching, and please share!! :) In today's video, we're taking suggestions and putting dry ice to the test in a couple extreme environments.\n\nSubscribe & \u201cRing the Bell\u201d: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For sponsorship requests or business opportunities please contact me directly: \n\nMusic by: Martin Landh - \u201cLocked Out\u201d\nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound: \n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

If you check them out, please let them know that Grant Thompson sent you.  Thanks! :)  First was a \u201clost foam casting\u201d tutorial by \u201cThe Art of Weapons\u201d ( and a Rubber Band gun designed by \u201cRBGuns\u201d (  I modified the template from RBGuns to make the styrofoam mold. \n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nThe gun is solid aluminum, made from melted down soda cans.\n\nI spent over 100 hours of time, and 7 styrofoam prototypes to make this video.  About a third of the time was spent filing and sanding the gun.  Each time I poured a casting for the gun, the trigger guard wouldn\u2019t complete all the way through, so I kept making new styrofoam guns, modifying the designs slightly until it worked.  \n\nOnce I got a fairly clean casting, I put 2 days into filing down rough points, and sanding them smooth.  \n\nThe gun could use a little more work, and it\u2019s not perfect, but this experiment was mainly a proof of concept that nearly anything you can imagine can be made fairly easily with the \u201clost foam casting\u201d technique.  Overall, I really am happy with the gun though!  It weighs 556 grams, and is really quite smooth to feel.\n\nFor future projects, I plan to work more with green sand casting.  I believe it will leave a nicer finish overall and won\u2019t require as many prototypes to get it right :)  Instead of foam, wood plugs can be used to make the molds, or even real weapons for that matter.

(#ad)\n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nweBoost.com.  The weBoost staff reached out and invited me to collaborate on a video idea for their new line of weBoost products. \n\nAbout a month ago, they reached out to see whether I had ever heard about cell phone signal boosting.\n\nIt was actually a new concept to me, even though they'd been selling products like this for over a decade, under the name \u201cWilson Electronics\u201d.\n\nOur house has always had trouble with reception, so I had one of their systems installed so I could test it for myself, and measure the results before making claims on what it could do.\n\nI did a fair amount of research on how cell phone technology works in general, and different ways signals could be enhanced.  And since most people don't have any idea how phones work or where the signals come from, I thought it would be appropriate to make a video with tips and tricks that people could try out themselves, to learn and explore the invisible radio world around them.\n\nOriginally my thinking was to create a number of different projects that could be done with the weBoost system itself, or projects that related to the concepts of signal boosting.\n\nAmong these ideas were; \n- Making a mini radio you could use to broadcast your voice on your kitchen radio.\n- Building a mini audio amplifier powerful enough to drive a large 8ohm speaker.\n- Ripping the weBoost amplifier apart, and seeing how it could re-purposed for something else.\n\nIn the end I felt that a \u201cLife Hack\u201d video showing 10 tips and tricks, would be the best.\n\nI created the video to show 10 ways you could find, or create, better signals, but I also tried to design it so you'd be learning more about how the cellular system works, at the same time.  \n\nThere is a lot of education mixed in with the projects.  So in a way it's kind of like a mini training course that'll get you involved with understanding the networks you've always used, but never really been aware of.\n\nI hope you learned something new you can start using.  And if not, please watch the video again.

I got the inspiration for using seeds as eyes in this video: \n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nI remembered someone showing me how to make an apple into a swan while I was in England in 2001.  I can't remember who it was though, and I just remember that it was a nice try, and although the wings looked cool, and head and neck were terrible.\n\nI really liked the idea though, so I spent an entire day cutting up apples in different ways to see if I could make it better.\n\nI also saw a video online where someone used apple seeds to make eyes ( which was really awesome, so I tried to incorporate that in.\n\nI ended up with this method for making the apple swan, which I think really looks incredible, and we ended up putting them on display for some dinner guests we had that night.

But I stumbled across an idea that really intrigued me (  There wasn't any information at all, and I couldn't find the idea duplicated anywhere else.  Just this one picture of an apple cut like a tic-tac-toe grid rather than cut into quarters.  And another picture showing the apple wrapped with a rubber band to hold it together.\n\nLuckily, my wife always has apples on hand, so I got experimenting.\n\nFirstly, I tried cutting the apple as seen in the picture.  My overall impression was that the pieces didn't look the way I was used to seeing apple slices, but I was surprised by how much faster it was to cut them this way, and really happy to see there wasn't a pile of apple core pieces that had to be cleaned up afterward.  Just one bit of apple core that was easily discarded, or composted. \n\nNext I tried experimenting with the rubber band around the apple.  The idea is that by keeping the pieces held together with an elastic, the apple slices won't turn brown.  I tested this idea on numerous apples and found that given enough time, they all eventually go brown, but keeping the pieces together keeps them in pretty good condition for up to around 3 hours, which could be long enough to get them to work or school just in time for snacks or lunch.  In any case, keeping the slices together was far more effective then putting them in a container, or in a ziplock baggie. \n\nI have also experimented with using lemon juice on apple slices.  The idea is that the citric acid in the lemon juice prevents the fruit from oxidizing.  That is true!  In my experiments I had apple slices last up to 8.5 hours without turning brown at all.  They may have gone even longer than that, but I ate them.\n\nWhile I was starting to film this video, my wife gave me a really great suggestion.  She said, why not turn the apples upside down when you cut them?  This way they are a lot more stable because they have a bigger base to work from.  Genius!\n\nIf you're looking for more cool tricks you can do with apples, check out my video on how to make an \"Edible Apple Swan\"   Apple art is fun, easy, and available, so give it a try and see how yours turns out :)\n\nFor one final experiment, I set up a time trial to see how the traditional method of cutting apples would compare to this new method of slicing apples.  I found that the traditional (cutting into quarters, then cutting out the cores) method took 49 seconds to make 8 slices, while the new Apple Hack method took only 10 seconds for the same results!  That's 5 times faster!\n\nSo my final conclusion is that this Apple Hack is indeed 5 x faster, easier, more convenient, and saves a baggie if you use an elastic instead.  In general, it just makes a lot more sense.\n\nIt's one of those concepts that jumps out and makes you say, why haven't we always been doing this??!\n\nWatch for the full video, to see more experiments and explanations, and in the mean time start cutting your apples upside down! :) FTC Disclaimer: This video was sponsored by VW.

He pulled a piece of PVC pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could make a project with it. A blowgun was the first idea that came to mind, and quickly snowballed into a really awesome project idea!\n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nThis is an original project idea which came right out of the blue a couple of weeks ago, but is among my favorites already!\n\nThe blowgun is so simple and cheap to make, anyone can do it, and the best part is it looks completely legit, and can fire with amazing precision.\n\nWhen my 5 year old son pulled a piece of plastic pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could do a project I immediately thought of making a blow dart gun. But to make it safer for indoor use, I tried using paper for ammunition. I rolled up a post-it note, and shoved the tip of a crayon inside to add some weight.\n\nWhen we shot the dart, it flew over 100 feet away at high velocity, making me realize there is a real project here waiting to be developed.\n\nI spent the next 5 days evolving different prototypes, and experimenting with different types of homemade ammunition.\n\nI let my kids try shooting darts made with nails, but their lungs weren't powerful enough to get the darts to stick into targets, so we use marshmallows instead. The pipe is the perfect width for mini-marshmallows and can still shoot them fast enough to hurt a little, but still safe enough for indoor use.\n\nThe blowguns can be customized with different color schemes in a way that's so simple it's nearly mind blowing.\n\nMany people have asked how to make the precision laser sight. It's just a 2\" piece of the same PVC pipe, with 8 screws, as seen in the video. Simply insert the laser, and adjust the screws until the laser is pointing directly at the place where the blowgun hits the target, then make sure the screws are relatively tight so the laser doesn't move.\u00a0\n\nHave fun and good luck!

It feels so good on the teeth to bite into it, and my kids go crazy for them .. so I spent a bit of time researching how they're made commercially.\n\nMy biggest motivation for doing this was to see if we could make our own at home, and I'm actually still trying to figure out how to make gelatin and corn syrup from scratch, so if I can figure out how to do that, maybe I'll show how to do it in another project video.\n\nOnly a small handful of you have ever seen the LEGO Gummy video I made in 2010, and that's because it was nearly 5 years ago, before I really got serious about making videos.  I took it off my channel in 2012 because I had full intentions of making a better version, so here it is .. 3 years later! :)\n\nNow I wanted to make candies that made people look twice, and LEGO bricks instantly came to mind because what's more awesome than LEGO and gummy put together?  But I wasn't sure where could you get a mold for making LEGO bricks.\n\nSurfing around the internet, I stumbled across an awesome Instructable by SFHandyman: \n\nTo my amazement, not only had he shown how to make a mold for making LEGO candy, he also made LEGO gummies as well!  \n\nI played around with loads of variations in recipes to see what texture and tastes I liked the best.  And I've kept experimenting off and on for the last 4 years, using my kids and wife for feedback.  They gobble them up no matter what variations I use, but I've finally settled on 1/2 cup of very cold water, 1/4 cup of corn syrup, 2 packets of unflavored gelatin, and 1 pack of Jell-O.  I've found that the corn syrup seems to help smooth out the texture and the taste.\n\nIf you try making this recipe, it's very important to start the gelatin in cold water.  Stir it up, then let it sit for 5 minutes before you turn on the heat.  Otherwise, you'll get gobby clumps of undissolved gelatin in your syrup that doesn't look very appetizing.  \n\nI originally made my silicone mold with a 2 part mix from a special effects supply company.  I used real LEGO bricks set on a LEGO base, and built a makeshift retaining wall with bricks and play-dough.  I don't plan to make a tutorial on how to make the mold, but I want to do a video on how to make a silicone mold in general.  It's amazing to see how much detail the silicone can transfer to the final gummy products.  If you look closely at my candies you can even see the little \u201cLEGO\u201d text on top of the gummy LEGO studs.\n\nTo make sour gummies, we often add citric acid.  They are incredible!  But if you don't have citric acid, try taking SFHandyman's suggestion and add vitamin C.  The citric and ascorbic acids in the vitamins sour them the same way, which actually makes them taste just as great, and enriches them with vitamin C as well. Try AUDIBLE with a free audiobook.

The water got softer, and our bath felt like luxury and pure bliss.\n\nI decided right then and there (in the bath tub) that I was going to figure out how to make one of these amazing devices, and share it with the world.\n\nI put the idea on the shelf for awhile to focus on other projects, but my interest was reawakened one night as my family and I were watching a YouTube channel called \"What's Up Moms\".  They had a cool bath bomb video ( that inspired me to try again.\n\nI followed Brooke's instructions perfectly, changing only the color and the amount of water slightly, and to my great satisfaction, this recipe worked perfectly!  ..which meant my wife and I enjoyed another bath bomb experience that night.\n\nWith Valentines Day quickly approaching, my goal was to come up with a cool project idea that anyone could share with their partner, and be proud of.  I wanted a project that was \"King of Random Style\", but still gentle and elegant enough to make a woman happy, and genuinely excited about her gift as well.  \n\nI spent weeks experimenting with different ideas, colors, and molds, and developed ideas ranging from black Bob-ombs and round bath bombs, to sticks of TNT.\n\nUltimately I settled on a red/pink stick of dynamite, because it looks cool, and turns the water pink as it diffuses.\n\nMy wife guided me in my choices of essential oils, based on what she prefers, so the only thing left for me to figure out was how to make the wick useful.\n\nThe idea of tying a secret gift, like jewelry, to the end of the string then packing it into the bath bomb during production came to me as I was nearing the end of my prototyping.

He didn't expect I'd end up making these!\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nThe weather has cooled off quite a bit, which has turned my interest back to keeping warm by casting metal.  \n\nThis time round I wanted to play with higher temperature metals, like brass.  So I made a trip to a local shooting range, and salvaged a whole bucket-load of spent brass casings.\n\nQuite a few people have asked whether my backyard foundry can melt brass, and I was curious myself, so I threw a few handfuls of casings into a crucible and fired them up.\n\nI tried using lump charcoal because it burns hotter and faster than briquettes, and a clay crucible purchased from the internet because it withstands heat better, and lasts longer than steel.\n\nI was impressed that the brass melted down without hesitation, and I was able to easily cast mini brass muffins the same day.\n\nA couple things worth mentioning are that the melting point of brass is around the boiling point of zinc.  I noticed this in real-life when the metal started bubbling, and shooting out white flames.  I wasn't sure what it was until I looked it up, but it was most likely zinc oxide fumes being released.\n\nZinc Oxide can be toxic in large quantities, and although it's never happened to me, claims are that it can cause metal fume fever, which gives flu like symptoms.\n\nYou should also know that brass is over 3 times heavier than aluminum, so expect the crucible to have a lot more weight to it, making it harder to handle.\n\nMy dad was visiting at the time and confirmed my thoughts about it by suggesting I try making something more practical and useful.  So I thought it would be fun to make some \"Brass Knuckle\" paperweights.\n\nI looked online at different varieties of brass knuckles, then drew my own version in photoshop, and used the \"Styro-Slicer\" and the lost-foam casting technique to make a rough pair of knuckles.\n\nI cast another pair the same way, and spent another 8 hours sanding and buffing them up to a mirror finish, then wondered how I could take them to the next level.\n\nSpikes seemed like a cool idea, inspired by a picture I saw on a google image search, so I stopped at an alternative clothing store and picked up a spiked choker collar, and repurposed the spikes for my piece of metal art.\n\nThese are not designed or intended to be used as weapons.  Possession of Brass Knuckles is illegal in most countries, (but not where I live), however I created these simply for artistic expression, and use them mainly as workshop d\u00e9cor.  (paperweights). Did you know you can make an AC arc welder using parts from your microwave?  I just finished mine, so join me in this video as we put its welding capabilities to the test!\n\nEndcard Links:\n\nArc Welder PT. 1: \nArc Welder PT. 2: \nThe Scariac:  \nThe Metal Melter: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING: \n\nWelding galvanized metals can release toxic zinc-oxide fumes.  Proper eye protection and ventilation are recommended.  I run the system on 240 VAC, which is metered by a power controller I built called the \"Scariac\".  It's similar to the idea of a Variac (variable auto-controller), with a few more hazards to be aware of.  The Micro-Welder itself does not have an on-off switch, and can pose a fire hazard if plugged directly into a mains power socket.  I made this to be used exclusively with the Scariac.  (Look for how to build that in another project.)  Stick welding, and/or the modification of a Microwave Oven Transformer (M.O.T), can be very dangerous and presents risk of UV radiation, shock hazards, burns, fires, fumes and a multitude of other risks.  This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training.  Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in serious injury.  Use of this video content is at your own risk.\n\nMusic By: Jason Shaw (TU-FeelsGood2B) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nthepaashaas \n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nThis video is the end result of 3 other project videos which will be edited and uploaded over the next couple of months.  Those videos will show how I modified the transformers, and how to control the current, but they aren't available at the moment, hence the \"Coming Soon\" on the annotations.\n\nThis project video comes after quite a bit of thinking and experimenting with different ways to modify the microwave stick welder into something that actually works, and would actually be a useful tool to have around the shop.\n\nThere are a few videos on the internet that show various people who have tried making a stick welder from a Microwave Oven Transformer.  There are even a couple of tutorials suggesting how to  do it.  However, in my experience of trying to duplicate these projects, my MOT welder either got so hot that the insulation on the wires melted and shorted it out, and/or it didn't provide enough power to strike and maintain an arc.\n\nTo date, I haven't seen a video or project where anyone actually welded anything with one of these \"so-called\" microwave welders.  The most that's been shown is to lay a bead on a piece of metal.  But this doesn't prove it can weld.  My earlier attempts could also lay a bead, but they didn't have enough heat or penetration to make anything stick.  A welder also needs a way to reliably control the amperage (which no other project does).  I saw one project where dimmer switches were used on the primary coils, however dimmer switches are only able to handle around 600 watts, and these stick welders require upwards of 2,000-3,000 watts.  In my experience, the dimmer switches fail very quickly and within a couple minutes of trying to weld.\n\nI'm happy to say that the welder in my project does work for me.  It welds 1/16\" AC rods very well, and I believe the transformer temperatures are very reasonable and sustainable for the amount of welding I plan to do as a simple hobbiest welder.\n\nTo see exactly how I built this welder, look for Part 1 and Part 2 on how to make the Microwave Stick Welder.

Glass bottles are not recommended, as the ice expands when freezing and can shatter the glass explosively. Use of video content is at own risk. \n\nMusic By:  (Remember The Dreams) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nThe viral YouTube video: \"How to Chill A Coke In just a second!!\" ( and the process of nucleation was inspired by \"Self-Freezing Coke - Crazy from Kong!\"  \n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nI knew water could be turned to instant ice ( but was amazed to see that soda could be supercooled as well.\n\nThe anomaly of \"self freezing soda\" has been observed by many people, usually by accident. Some people put a soda in the freezer to chill it, but then forget about it. When they've remembered and gone to get it, it's liquid until they open it, leaving them puzzled. Some people have noticed the effect by leaving the soda outside in cold temperatures.\n\nThere is a vending machine in Hong Kong that sells supercooled Coke bottles, and the instructions to trigger nucleation is the same as in this video, however they recommend taking a sip when the cap is on. I believe this is to increase the chances of impurities being introduced into the liquid, making nucleation more likely. \n\nFrom what I've seen, the results in this experiment form an even thicker slush than the vending machine in Hong Kong.\n\nTo get this effect, I put 4 bottles of 500mL (16.9 oz) soda in a freezer set at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) between 3:15- 4:00 hours. The longer they are in, the more dramatic and solid the slushy freeze will be. However, anytime after 3:15 hours there is a chance of them freezing before you take them out.\n\nEvery freezer will be a little different temperature, and I've noticed the location of your bottles in the freezer makes a dramatic difference on freeze times. For best results, choose one consistent location in your freezer, and play around with freeze times to see what works best for you. In my freezer, the middle of the center rack settles at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) and takes 3:15 to super chill 4 bottles.\n\nRemember that the longer the freezer door is open, the more cold air will escape, and it will make your freeze times take much longer because your freezer has to cool down again. I've also noticed that the more frozen items you have in your freezer, the faster your soda will chill. In contrast, the less items in your freezer, the longer your soda will take to cool. Bottom line is, use a consistent environment for your experiments, and you'll get consistent results!\n\nI also experimented with 2 litter bottles, and had great results between 4-5 hours. The whole bottle slushifies in an instant. \n\nI experimented with Gatorade, Fresca, Mexican Sprite, Rootbeer, Orange sodas, Coke, Diet Coke, in bottle form, as well as in cans. I had super cooled success with them all!\n\nThe trick to getting the 3 second slush, is quickly releasing the pressure in the bottle and re-securing the cap, flipping the bottle upside down, and back upright again. This is because the forming ice crystals will be moved around the length of the bottle, and trigger nucleation for the rest of the soda.\n\nIf you were to just take the cap off, ice will form, and it will slowly spread downward, but might take upwards of 2 minutes for the bottle to completely freeze.\n\nRemoving the pressure very slowly from the bottle, can keep the soda liquified, and give you the choice opportunity to play with supercooled soda outside of the bottle.

Lay out a square napkin, and begin by folding it up diagonally to form a triangle.\n\n2. Fold up each of the bottom corners, to meet the point at the top.  If your napkin isn't perfectly square, just do the best you can with what you have. \n\n3. Now fold the bottom point, three quarters of the way up,\n\n4. then fold it back on itself so the point is back at the bottom. \n\n5. Go ahead and flip it over\n\n6. Take one of the back edges, and fold it a third of the way in. \n\n7. The other side, folds over next and is secured by tucking the corner into the flap at the bottom. \n\n8. Flip it over one more time, and now just peel the two sides down like you're peeling a banana. \n\nOpen the base, stand it upright, and your cloth crown is finished.  \n\nThis simple fold is quick and easy, and can add a very elegant touch to your table settings.  \n\nIf you don't have any cloth napkins, try using paper napkins instead. \n\nCredits:\n\nMusic by: Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.com\n\nProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean.\n\nSpecial interest was given to the following websites for more ideas, and refreshing techniques;\n\n\n\n How to fold a square napkin into The \"Candle\".

Start with a square napkin, and turn it slightly so that one point is facing up. \n\n2. Now take the bottom tip, and fold it up toward the top until the two corners match.  This should form a rough triangle.\n\n3. The next step is fold the base up just a couple of inches and press it down flat. \n\n4. At this point, we can flip the whole thing over, so the triangle is pointing to the left.\n\n5. Take the bottom point and fold it up so the tip is just past the center. \n\n6. Start rolling the whole thing into a tube, starting from the bottom, and working toward the top.  When your roll is finished, you might want to push the uneven ends back into the tube, then tuck the loose end, neatly into the cuff.  This should give you a nice sturdy base to hold your napkin upright. \n\n7. To finish off, just turn one layer of the tip down.\n\n8. Then shape the the other layer to look like a flame. \n\nNow your candle looks like it's burning, with a bit of wax dripping off the top.  It's completely finished, and ready to impress. \n\nNow if you don't have cloth napkins, try making this with a paper napkin instead.  It works just as well, as long as your gentle, and are careful not to tear the paper.  \n\nCredits:\n\nMusic by: Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.com\n\nProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean.\n\nSpecial interest was given to the following websites for more ideas, and refreshing techniques;\n\n\n\n How to fold a square napkin into a Simple \"Silverware Pouch\".

Fold the top left corner, of the top layer, down to the opposite side.\n\n4. Go ahead and flip the whole thing over.\n\n5. Fold the right side a third of the way in.\n\n6. Then fold the left edge back over top and tuck the bottom corner, down inside the pocket on the other.\n\nWhen it's flipped right-side-up, you can see the pouch is completely finished, so just add some silverware and set it out to impress. \n\nOf course, if you don't have any cloth napkins, these folds will work just as well, with paper napkins, and plastic utensils.  \n\nCredits:\n\nMusic by Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.com\n\nFind me on FB: \n\nProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean.\n\nSpecial interest was given to the following websites for more ideas, and refreshing techniques;\n\n\n\n How to fold a square napkin into The \"Pyramid\".

It will travel up the diverging spark gap, sometimes called a \"Jacob's ladder\" until the arc is so weak it breaks.\n\nThis project is dangerous and isn't of much practical use as far as I can tell, but was a way to visibly see electricity in plasma form.\n\nBecause the MOT is unballasted, you can expect the current draw to get so high that the breaker will trip every-time if allowed to continue for an extended period of time. Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to make an 800 amp Spot Welder from common materials and for dirt cheap!

(\n\nWhile I was working on different prototypes for that exploding blowgun ammo, I got wondering about the cap-gun caps themselves, and how they exploded on impact.\n\nI spent a considerable amount of time on the internet researching, and trying to figure out what the composition of cap gun caps were.  I was very curious to learn what composition could be stable enough to sit undisturbed, indefinitely, but explode suddenly and powerfully when hit with enough force.\n\nArmstrong's Mixture is highly volatile and extremely dangerous compound in large quantities, and has been known to explode just by stirring it too aggressively.  However in small batches like cap-gun caps, it's exciting, and relatively harmless.\n\nI found a few websites, PDF's and online studies suggesting different ways to make improvised versions of the mixture using safety matches.  This method doesn't create a pure composition though, and there really isn't any way to measure exact amounts.  But in experimenting, I did figure out an easy way to make it work consistently, every time.\n\nAt this point I have a fair amount of experience with Armstrong's Mixture, and some things you need to know about it are this;\n\n- Treat it like it could explode spontaneously at any moment, and make sure you have safety precautions in place.  This way if it does, you'll be prepared for it.\n\n- Stick to very small batches, and treat it with caution and respect.  Don't use more than 1 match-head.  2 at the most!  This makes enough powder for 10 Thunder Caps, which are about 5-10 times more powerful than regular cap-gun caps in-and-of themselves.  And while the powder from only 2 matches might not seem like much ... trust me, you DON'T want it going off all at once.  \n\n- If you mix it up too aggressively, it can go off unexpectedly, and can be extremely loud, leaving your ears ringing.  It can also be set off with friction, impact, heat, and electrical sparks.  Wear ear-plugs and safety glasses at all times.  \n\nSaying all that, I've never actually had the composition go off unexpectedly, so long as I was being extremely gentle with it.  \n\nI usually keep each movement as light as a feather and typically mix it with wooden sticks, razor blades, and anything else that is convenient and expendable, so far with 100% success.  It's important to note that I always expect it to go off at any time, and am prepared in case it does.\n\nAttempts to get the mixture to go off while stirring aggressively were hit or miss.  Most of the time nothing happened.  However, every now and again, it would explode when it was least expected.   \n\nI believe the \u201cThunder Caps\u201d project to be a safe and enjoyable experience, so long as it's experimented with in very small quantities.  \n\nHowever if you try this yourself, remember that any actions and reactions you produce are at your own risk, and you are responsible for the consequences.

So I asked Ritchie if he could help me engineer a sugar rocket.\n\nMost rocket clubs won't let you fly sugar motors, except on special experimental launch days.  However, the \u201cRandomizer\u201d rocket can also be used with commercial \u201cEstes\u201d D12-3 and E9-6 black power motors.  So if you go with those, there's a good chance they'll let you fly your rocket at any club launch.\n\nThe rocket can fly over 1,000 feet high, and depending on the winds, can stay in the air for around 5 minutes while it floats back to the ground, so it's important to be super cautious where, and when, you launch to avoid doing any damage.\n\nThis video completes the rocket building series, and I'm really excited to share my passion for building and launching rockets with completely home-made equipment.  In my opinion, it's the best way to learn about how rocketry really works.

I was looking for ideas for a small sword I could make out of styrofoam and found this: (\n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nAfter I melted my first batch of soda cans into liquid aluminum, the first thing I though of making was a sai, like Rafael from the Ninja Turtles. \n\nI didn't have a mold, but I remembered seeing a technique for \"lost foam casting\" where something could be made out of styrofoam and buried in sand, then hot molten metal poured in overtop to burn away the foam, and take the shape of the object.\n\nI tried cutting the styrofoam with a knife, but it just made a mess, and the sai looked terrible.  So I made a hot wire \"Styro-Slicer\" so I could cut foam cleaner. (\n\nWith the Styro-Slicer complete, I quickly traced out the shape of a sword freehand, and tried casting it, and it turned out perfect!  Exactly as the foam looked, and I was amazed.\n\nSo I wondered if I could make a sword that looked better and more professional.  \n\nI did a Google image search for \"sword template\", and came across a picture of a playful \"Master Sword\" that was the perfect size for a small cosplay type sword.\n\nI printed out the shape, glued it to some styrofoam, and was really glad to see I could trace the paper with the hot wire foam cutter, to get a really clean and professional looking piece.\n\nThe first prototype I made wasn't originally intended to be made into a video, but made a cameo appearance at the end of my first styrofoam casting video (\n\nSince then I've wanted to make a version that was 3D and looked awesome, but it's taken a lot of time figure out how I wanted it to look.\n\nI had my friend Ritchie from Sonic Dad make a vector of the image so I could try scaling it for templates, which he very kindly did for me.  But unfortunately I didn't end up using it because I needed to create different layers to make the sword 3D.\n\nI spent 3 days in photoshop creating different designs, layers, and template prototypes, until I finally came up with a design I liked.\n\nFrom there I tested different versions of the template on foam, so I could understand how many layers were needed to get a clean cast.  (When the blade was only 1 layer thin, the metal wouldn't penetrate all the way down).  I made and cast over 12 swords to get a feel for what worked best, and what didn't.  And this design is the result of all that experimenting and prototyping.\n\nFree \"Mini Master Sword\" Template:   A homemade substance that molds like play-dough, then hardens into silicone rubber.  \n\nNow you can make anything on a budget!\n\nSee the full project video: Coming Soon!\n\nNext Video: QC#103: \u2013 Coming Soon!\nPrevious Video:  QC#101 \u2013 LEGO Candy Mold: \n\n\"Quick Clips\" are clips of random experiments in a minute or less.\n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nMiracle Safe: \nReloading Primers: \nTablecloth Parachutes: \nFloating Coin: \n\nMusic by Scott & Brendo \u201cOne More Time\u201d Instrumental\niTunes: \nYouTube: www.youtube.com/scottandbrendo\n\nProject Inspired By: Mikey77's Instructable on Ooogoo: \n\nWARNING:  \n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

That wasn't acceptable because I needed something that would harden in 24 hours or less.\n\nAbout 3 years ago I came across an instructable by Mikey77 showing that mixing corn starch into the silicone caulk could be used to make it firm up in under an hour.\n\nI did a number of experiments of my own, and eventually found out that corn starch wasn't actually needed at all, but that all you needed was to add a little food coloring.\n\nI still like to use corn starch though because it helps prevent the caulk from sticking to my hands as I work with it.  The stuff is really hard to get off if it sticks to skin!

I used real LEGO bricks set on a LEGO base, and built a makeshift retaining wall with bricks and play-dough.  \n\nI didn't plan to make a tutorial on how to make the mold, but I've been inundated with requests for the last year, so I finally did it! :)\n\nIt's amazing to see how much detail the silicone can transfer to the final gummy products.  If you look closely at my candies you can even see the little \u201cLEGO\u201d text on top of the gummy LEGO studs.

On that idea, I practiced until I could prove it worked, and then until I  felt like I'd mastered the technique.\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nComputer paper with black ink is the tinder of choice for practicing this technique because anyone should have access to it, and it's fairly consistent and reliable.  \n\nThe bottle needs to be filled with water, and ideally should have no air bubbles inside.  By turning the bottle upside down and using the rounded convex part at the top, we can use a water bottle as a make-shift magnifying lens.  \n\nThe curved water refracts the sunlight, and give the ability to focus it.  The closer the rounded lens is to resembling a liquid sphere, the better it will work.  If bubbled are trapped in the bottle, they will distort the sunlight and weaken the intensity of the beam.\n\nThis technique isn't easy, and takes a lot of practice to master, so don't wait until you're in a survival situation to try it.

It works because rapid compression heats the air in the chamber to the ignition point of tinders, such as char cloth.  The tinder can then be used to ignite kindling, and develop a flame.\n\nIt's thought that the fire piston may have inspired Rudolf Diesel in his creation of the diesel engine around 1892.\n\nI had a fire piston I made out of copper tubing, but I wanted to make one out of clear acrylic so I could actually see the ignition of the tinder.  It seemed it mystery how, or when, it actually lit, and I wanted to see.  \n\nFINDING ACRYLIC:  I used google.com to find different plastics companies in my area, and called around until I found one that sold acrylic tubing and rods to the public.  I went for a visit, and luckily they had  some lengths of scrap tubing they couldn't sell.  I asked them if I could use it for a science project, and they gave it to me for free.\n\nThe tubing I used was 1/2\" inside diameter, and the rod was 1/2\" outside diameter - clear acrylic.  \n\nThis piston was given to a subscriber, as part of a contest I held in celebration of 10,000 subscribers on my YouTube channel.  \n\nSee more information on the fire piston on Wikipedia;  Most people wouldn't think of butter as a flammable substance, but in this project they are!

Do not use near any flammable or explosive material.  Use of this video content is at your own risk.\n\nMusic By: Music by Jason Shaw (TU-ForeverBelieve) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nThis was an original idea.  I had been playing around with making candles with vegetable oil and was about to make a video on some ways to do that.  One night an idea popped into my head about melted butter and I wondered if that would work.\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nTo make butter burn, we actually need to vaporize it first!\n\nA bit of rolled up toilet paper acts as a wick, and when pushed down into the center of a block of butter and ignited, we've may have created the worlds simplest candle.  \n\nThe butter below the wick begins to melt and soak up into the paper.  The heat aids the liquid butter to be released as a vapor, and it's the vapor that's flammable.\n\nI used an 8oz block of butter and cut it in half.  Each half burns for about 4 hours each, however, during the last 2 hours it seems most of the butter liquifies and your wick may need some support.  I used a paperclip to give some stability.\n\nAnother idea would be to cut the butter into 8 sections of 1oz each and make 8 candles!  Each ounce should burn for about 1 hour.

Colored liquids, or liquids in colored bottles can still work, but energy is lost, and that could be the difference between getting tinder ignition or not.\n\nAfter making fires with various water bottles, and posting my first video on it in 2010, someone commented and said they saw a guy on Dual Survival do it with his urine. That sounded pretty amazing to me, so I looked up the link on YouTube and saw the clip.\n\nIt seemed like he had quite a bit of trouble actually getting his fire going, and I thought that if I were ever in a survival situation like that, the last thing I would want to be doing is trying for hours how to figure out how it works. It's better to be prepared beforehand.\n\nThis video comes after many experiments of playing with various techniques. I found that using plastic wrap and urine made a combination that gave great success, and within a minute or two I could have a flame! When done correctly, it works just the same as a magnifying glass. \n\nPracticing with the amount of pressure is key, because too little and you won't have a good lens. Too much, and the plastic bursts and you're soaking wet.\n\nFAQ's: \n\nQ: Why did I wrap an apple in plastic wrap?\n\nA: Of course the video is fictional, however the survival techniques portrayed are real. I wrapped my apple with plastic wrap because I've seen it done before at hotels, and I wanted to give an example of how random resources can be used as tools. If you don't wrap your apples in plastic wrap, perhaps you wrap your sandwich, or various other food items? The plastic baggie holding the celery can also be used in a very similar manner.\n\nQ: Why did I use a page from the map for tinder instead of grass or leaves? \n\nA: This liquid lens technique will light any tinder that could be lit with a magnifying glass, since that's what it is in essence. I used a piece of paper as an example because most people have access to that as a material they could practice with. I chose paper because it's easily duplicatable by anyone wanting to try. \n\nQ: Why does the urine change color just before I light the tinder? Did I cheat?\n\nA: The urine changes color mid video, and that's because when I went to re-set my camera for a different angled shot, I dropped the first sack of urine. Awkward to hold the sack, and adjust the camera on rocky terrain at the same time. I lost my urine and had to wait for another round .. which, by that point was more hydrated because of all the water I'd drank earlier, and therefore more clear in color. In either case, I have the same success igniting tinder with either liquid lens so the difference made by the color is negligible.  ",

In fact, some of the longest arachnid flights lasted for thousands of miles.\n\nToday, scientists widely debate the exact science behind spiders' ballooning, but one prominent theory suggests that spiders could be using the electric field in earth's atmosphere, in addition to the wind, to provide lift to their silk strands and send them sailing away.\n\nDiscover the amazing aerodynamics of spiders' wingless flight in this latest video from Decoder.

Florence, or as Italians might say, Firenze, was the home to a seemingly inordinate amount of the art, architecture, literature, and cultural output of the Renaissance. Artists like Michelangelo, Leonardo daVinci, Sandro Boticelli, and many others were associated with the city, and the money of patrons like the Medici family made a lot of the art possible. Today you'll learn about how the Renaissance came to be, and what impact it had on Europe and the world.\n\nOur Sources:\nHunt, Lynn et al.  The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures, 6th ed.

So we're going to try to do two things in this series. Help show you the usefulness of statistics, but also help you become a more informed consumer of statistics. From probabilities, paradoxes, and p-values there's a lot to cover in this series, and there will be some math, but we promise only when it's most important. But first, we should talk about what statistics actually are, and what we can do with them.

Averages are everywhere so today we\u2019re going to discuss how these measures differ, how their relationship with one another can tell us a lot about the underlying data, and how they are sometimes used to mislead. \n\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

They can help understand test scores, income inequality, spot stock bubbles, and plan gambling junkets.

Welcome to Crash Course Computer Science! So today, we\u2019re going to take a look at computing\u2019s origins, because even though our digital computers are relatively new, the need for computation is not. Since the start of civilization itself, humans have had an increasing need for special devices to help manage laborious tasks, and as the scale of society continued to grow, these computational devices began to play a crucial role in amplifying our mental abilities. From the abacus and astrolabe to the difference engine and tabulating machine, we\u2019ve come a long way to satisfying this increasing need, and in the process completely transformed commerce, government, and daily life. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: \n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\n\n\nWant more Crash Course in person?

But as the scale of human civilization continued to grow as did the demand for more sophisticated and powerful devices. Soon these cabinet-sized electro-mechanical computers would grow into room-sized behemoths that were prone to errors. But is was these computers that would help usher in a new era of computation - electronic computing. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: \n\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: \n\nWe\u2019ve got merch!\n\n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\n\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - \nTwitter - \nTumblr -  \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: \nCC Kids:  Today, Carrie Anne is going to take a look at how those transistors we talked about last episode can be used to perform complex actions. With the just two states, on and off, the flow of electricity can be used to perform a number of logical operations, which are guided by a branch of mathematics called Boolean Algebra. We\u2019re going to focus on three fundamental operations - NOT, AND, and OR - and show how they were created in a series of really useful circuits. And its these simple electrical circuits that lay the groundwork for our much more complex machines. \n\n*CORRECTION* AT 1:27 the graph says \"Quinary System\" but then the graph shows 10 possible states - which is actually decimal. Technically, there should be only 5 possible values there, but the overall concept is still the same.   \n\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: \n\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: \n\nWe\u2019ve got merch!\n\n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\n\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - \nTwitter - \nTumblr -  \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: \nCC Kids:  Please take our PBS Digital Studios Survey! \n\nToday, we\u2019re going to take a look at how computers use a stream of 1s and 0s to represent all of our data - from our text messages and photos to music and webpages.

They were for codebreaking and calculating artillery tables during World War II - but like most tools we human use, we eventually looked for ways to make them playthings. And over the next three decades the advances of computer technology and the tentative curiosity of many engineers and programmers would inspire a new culture and eventually the first true coin-operated video game in 1971.\n\nYou can play SpaceWar! yourself here:\n\n\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

So if you remember from last episode, we mentioned that the first arcade machine, Galaxy Game, happened to have a coin slot, but this was just the beginning. Nolan Bushnell, often considered the Father of the Video Game Industry, saw the opportunity for the commercialization of video games. Bushnell founded Atari and oversaw the development of its first game - Pong. And then, through some questionably ethical business strategies, Bushnell was able to get his machines into arcades all across the United States. But if this is all Atari had done, we probably wouldn\u2019t be dedicating an entire episode to it. Atari also played a major role in getting video games into the home with the Atari 2600 console. Video games were becoming a part of peoples\u2019 everyday lives and they were becoming a part of popular culture. But Atari wasn\u2019t the only video game company in the 1970s, it wasn\u2019t even the first. So we\u2019re going talk about some of the other companies that took part in the war for a place in our living rooms next week! \n\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

The key difference in patents and copyright is that patents are for THINGS. Copyright is for an idea. So, if you've come up with a great new invention, like for example, a condiment gun, you should get a patent.

A lot of people confuse trademark and copyright. Trademarks apply to things like company and product names and logos, packaging designs, and commercial designs. Basically, copyright protects ideas, but trademarks protect the things that help consumers tell companies apart. This ensures that consumers know the source of the goods they're buying. Without trademarks, it would be really difficult to buy the same product twice, and very easy for unscrupulous companies to pass off fakes and knock offs of the products you want.

So, what is money? And what is it for? And why do we use money? And why does it all disappear so quickly after payday? John will look into 75% of these questions, and if he doesn't come up with answers, we'll get into some interesting ideas along the way, at least.

Why, you may ask, are we covering US History, and not more World History, or the history of some other country, or the very specific history of your home region? Well, the reasons are many. But, like it or not, the United States has probably meddled in your country to some degree in the last 236 years or so, and that means US History is relevant all over the world. In episode 1, John talks about the Native Americans who lived in what is now the US prior to European contact. This is a history class, not archaeology, so we're mainly going to cover written history. That means we start with the first sustained European settlement in North America, and that means the Spanish. The Spanish have a long history with the natives of the Americas, and not all of it was positive. The Spanish were definitely not peaceful colonizers, but what colonizers are peaceful? Colonization pretty much always results in an antagonistic relationship with the locals. John teaches you about early Spanish explorers, settlements, and what happened when they didn't get along with the indigenous people. The story of their rocky relations has been called the Black Legend. Which is not a positive legend.\n\nTurn on the captions.

He covers the first permanent English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, the various theocracies in Massachusetts, the feudal kingdom in Maryland, and even a bit about the spooky lost colony at Roanoke Island. What were the English doing in America, anyway? Lots of stuff. In Virginia, the colonists were largely there to make money. In Maryland, the idea was to create a a colony for Catholics who wanted to be serfs of the Lords Baltimore. In Massachusetts, the Pilgrims and Puritans came to America to find a place where they could freely persecute those who didn't share their beliefs. But there was a healthy profit motive in Massachusetts as well. Profits were thin at first, and so were the colonists. Trouble growing food and trouble with the natives kept the early colonies from success. Before long though, the colonists started cultivating tobacco, which was a win for everyone involved if you ignore the lung cancer angle. So kick back, light up a smoke, and learn how America became profitable. DON'T SMOKE, THOUGH!

In short, these relations were poor. As soon as they arrived, the English were in conflict with the native people. At Jamestown, Captain John Smith briefly managed to get the colony on pretty solid footing with the local tribes, but it didn't last, and a long series of wars with the natives ensued. This pattern would continue in US history, with settlers pushing into native lands and pushing the inhabitants further west. In this episode, you'll learn about Wahunsunacawh (who the English called Powhatan), his daughter Pocahontas, King Philip's (aka Metacom) War, and the Mystic Massacre. By and large, the history of the Natives and the English was not a happy one, even Thanksgiving wasn't all it's cracked up to be. Support CrashCourse on Patreon: \n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. The English tried and failed for a decade to establish a foothold in the New World in native territory, leading to the lost colony of Roanoke: \nWhen Jamestown was finally established in Virginia in 1607, the local Powhatan tribes sought friendly relations with the settlers, which quickly deteriorated:  In which John Green teaches you about some of the colonies that were not in Virginia or Massachussetts. Old New York was once New Amsterdam. Why they changed it, I can say; ENGLISH people just liked it better that way, and when the English took New Amsterdam in 1643, that's just what they did. Before the English got there though, the colony was full of Dutch people  who treated women pretty fairly, and allowed free black people to hold jobs. John also discusses Penn's Woods, also known as Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was (briefly) a haven of religious freedom, and William Penn dealt relatively fairly with the natives his colony displaced. Of course, as soon as Penn died, the colonist started abusing the natives immediately. We venture as far south as the Carolina colonies, where the slave labor economy was taking shape. John also takes on the idea of the classless society in America, and the beginning of the idea of the American dream. It turns out that in spite of the lofty dream that everyone had an equal shot in the new world, there were elites in the colonies. And these elites tended to be in charge. And then their kids tended to take over when they died. So yeah, not quite an egalitarian paradise. In addition to all this, we get into the Salem Witch Trials, the treatment of women in the colonies, and colonial economics. Oh yeah, one more thing, before you comment about how he says we're talking about the American Revolution next week, but the end screen says Seven Years War, consider that perhaps the Seven Years War laid the groundwork for the revolution to happen. \n\nAlso, turn on the subtitles by clicking the CC button.

Confusing? Maybe. John argues that the Seven Years War, which is often called the French and Indian War in the US, laid a lot of the groundwork for the Revolution. More confusing? Why does this war have two names? Why were the French and Indians fighting each other? The Seven Years war was actually a global war that went on for nine years. I think I'm having trouble making this clear. Anyway, the part of this global war that happened in North America was the French and Indian War. The French and Indian tribes were the force opposing the British, so that's the name that stuck. Let's get away from this war, as it makes my head hurt. Other stuff was going on in the colonies in the 18th century that primed the people for revolution. One was the Great Awakening. Religious revival was sweeping the country, introducing new ideas about religion and how it should be practiced. At the same time thinkers like John Locke were rethinking the relationship between rulers and the ruled. So in this highly charged atmosphere, you can just imagine what would happen if the crown started trying to exert more control over the colonies. The colonists would probably just rise up, right? We'll see what happens next week.\n\nRead the Mystery Document in its entirety in the Minutes of the Provincial Province of Pennsylvania Vol. IX: \n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

Although interspecies interactions are mostly competitive, competition is pretty dangerous, so a lot of interactions are actually about side-stepping direct competition and instead finding ways to divvy up resources to let species get along.

This video is for anyone who wakes up feeling anxious and depressed every day and is looking for a way out. This was my path, and of course yours might be different, but my hope is something in this video will resonate with you and motivate you to try something new. I highly recommend reading \u201cThe Power of Now\u201d by Eckhart Tolle as another good starting point into meditation, what it means to be mindful, and the Ego. This is a video I should have made a long time ago. I\u2019m finally in a space where I need to admit it\u2019s time to step back from YouTube. Please watch the whole way through before forming an opinion or commenting. Thanks for listening. Thanks to the LAPD for working with me!

Porno Injuries\n\nVigorous bedroom exercise gives these sex athletes serious injuries \u2013 vaginal and anal tears are a daily part of the porn star\u2019s life, and in serious cases can cause incontinence.\n\n8.  Jerk-off Booths\n\nIn some pornographic stores, 'adult video arcades' still exist. These are private movie areas, where customers can try before they buy. \n\nAdult arcades originated from peep shows: Little coin-operated booths, which played early 20th century pornos. One of the first was \u2018What the Butler Saw\u2019, a voyeuristic scene of a woman undressing in her bedroom.\n\n7. Gangbang Legend\n\nSex with multiple partners has been documented as far back as the Roman times.\n\nToday, gangbang porn features anything from 12-50 men having sex with 1 woman.\n\nAnd in their efforts to shock, producers are always pushing sex acts to the limit.\n\nIn 2004, adult film actress Lisa Sparxxx achieved the world gangbang record, when she had sex with 919 men, as part of the Third Annual World Gangbang Championship.\n\n6. Fluffers\n\nThe name might sound cute, but fluffers are responsible for keeping porn stars in a state of arousal on set.\n\n5. Plastic Surgery\n\nPorn stars are under constant pressure to fit the industry\u2019s beauty ideal. \n\nProducers expect their female actors to get painful breast implants, because only girls with the biggest boobs will make it onto the DVD box covers.\n\n4. Incest Erotica\n\n82% of erotic literature is consumed by women and the advent of the Kindle has enabled a huge female audience to invest in niche fetish literature, which they can read discreetly wherever they are.\n\nErotica authors are now penning up to 1 porn \u2018novel\u2019 a week, in the new popular genre of \u2018hypno-incest\u2019: where characters are coerced, through mind control, to have sex with family members and animals.\n\nTitles include: 'Gay Cowboy: Pounded by the men who raised me', 'Hypnosis Gay Step Brother', 'Keeping it in the House', and 'Werewolves and Tentacles'.\n\n3. STIs\n\n69% of actors don't wear condoms when they\u2019re making adult films. And in climactic porno scenes, condoms are used just 10% of the time. Because of this, the industry is rife with sexually transmitted infections.\n\n\n2.'Barely Legal'\n\n'Teen' is the 2nd most popular porn search online, which is why 'Barely Legal' films do so well.\n\nThese movies feature 18-year-old girls posing as teenagers, but porno producers have found ways to get underage teens on screen.\n\n\n1.  Nazi Porn\n\nWeird porn is not a new phenomenon.\n\nIn the 1950s, the short-lived genre of holocaust erotica became very popular - especially in Israel.\n\nKnown as 'Stalag fiction', these books told sadistic stories about Nazi imprisonment in concentration camps, and sexual violence by dominatrix, SS guards.\n\nTitles such as 'I was Colonel Schultz's Private Bitch' were big hits with teenage boys, and it wasn\u2019t until the 60s that these publications were finally banned by the Israeli government.

Project MK-ULTRA\n\n\nIn 1953 the CIA launched a deadly mind-control program.\n\nMasked as \u2018intelligence research\u2019, they secretly administered LSD to the public and manipulated their mental states. The CIA\u2019s ultimate goal was to create a brainwashed assassin programmed to kill. \n\nPatients were also hypnotized and given electroshock therapy to try and create split personalities that could be used against the Russians in the Cold War.\n\nBut when investigative journalist Seymour Hersh reported illegal CIA surveillance in 1975, the American public were outraged. Further government investigations discovered thousands of files on MK-ULTRA and some truly disturbing human experiments. \n\n\n9. Operation Paperclip\n\nAfter WW2 the USA recruited 1,600 Nazi scientists in order to prevent their knowledge falling into Soviet hands.\n\nThe US government claimed that any hired German found to be a former Nazi would be excluded from the program - but this was a sham.\n\n\n\n8. CIA Drug Trafficking\n\nIn 1996 investigative journalist Gary Webb exposed the CIA for facilitating the sale of cocaine to LA street gangs.\n\nWebb alleged that in the 1980s the CIA targeted drugs to African-American communities \u2013 and millions of dollars worth of cocaine funded the CIA\u2019s army in Nicaragua.\n\n\n\n\n7. Operation Northwoods\n\nIn 1962 US military intelligence planned terrorist attacks on its own country. US operatives intended to blame these attacks on the Cuban government to justify a war against Cuba.\n\nThe operation involved hijacking planes and bombing US cities, to gain public support against Cuba\u2019s communist leader, Fidel Castro.\n\n\n\n6. The NSA Files\n\nIn 2013 computer analyst Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA was accessing tens of millions of Americans\u2019 online records and tracking phone calls \u2013 under the pretence of trying to uncover terrorist plots.\n\n\n5. COINTELPRO\n\nPeace activists suspected the FBI of infiltrating the anti-war movement - and they were right.\n\nOn March 8th 1971 they broke into an FBI office and stole hundreds of files, which revealed the bureau\u2019s true motives.\n\nThe Counter Intelligence Program was an aggressive, covert operation by the bureau to destroy Communism and the New Left.\n\n\n4. Operation Snow White\n\nIn the 1970s the Church of Scientology performed one of the largest infiltrations of US government in history. 5,000 undercover members raided 136 American agencies to steal documents critical of the church.\n\nIn 1977 former Scientology member Michael Meisner contacted the FBI, suspecting that the Scientology community was involved in criminal activities.\n\n\n\n3. Guatemala Syphilis Study\n\nBetween 1946 and 1948 the USA landed in Guatemala City and secretly infected 1,500 people with syphilis to test the effectiveness of penicillin. \n\nAt least 83 people died in these experiments, which had the approval of The Rockefeller Foundation and Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\n\n2. Gulf of Tonkin\n\nThe Vietnam War was started because of a lie.\n\nOn August 2nd 1964 America and North Vietnam engaged in military combat in the Gulf of Tonkin.\n\n\n\n\n1. Operation Mockingbird\n\nIn the 1950s the CIA launched a secret campaign to control the media, recruiting top journalists so they would have power over the New York Times, CBS, and Newsweek.  10 Unsolved Mysteries Of World War II\n\nUFOs, buried treasure, and missing people are just some of the many unresolved mysteries of World War Two.\n\nMusic = Bullet to the Brain by Kerry Muzzey 10 Scary Future Weapons Of War\n\nFrisbees of Death, Terminators and cyborg insects will rule the battlefields of the future and it's going to be scary.

In most cases those cycles will continue long after we're gone. A look at the history of climate change on Earth can give us some much needed perspective on our current climate dilemma because the surprising truth is, what we're experiencing now is different than anything this planet has encountered before. So, let's take a stroll down Climate History Lane and see if we can find some answers to a question that's been bugging Hank a lot lately - just how much hot water are we in?\n\nLike SciShow?

That's exactly what I mean, but it goes so much deeper than that. After the transistor was invented in 1947 one of the first available consumer technologies it was applied to was radios, so they could be made portable and higher quality. Hence the line in 'Brown-eyed Girl' - \"going down to the old mine with a transistor radio.\"\n\nBut more important to our lives today, the transistor made possible the microcomputer revolution, and hence the Internet, and also TVs, mobile phones, fancy washing machines, dishwashers, calculators, satellites, projectors etc. etc. A transistor is based on semiconductor material, usually silicon, which is 'doped' with impurities to carefully change its electrical properties. These n and p-type semiconductors are then put together in different configurations to achieve a desired electrical result. And in the case of the transistor, this is to make a tiny electrical switch. These switches are then connected together to perform computations, store information, and basically make everything electrical work intelligently.\n\nSpecial thanks to PhD Comics for awesome animations: \n\nAnd thanks to Henry Reich and Vanessa Hill for reviews of earlier drafts of this video.\n\nMusic: Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Decisions How does a transistor work?

Quantum bits or 'qubits' can exist in a superposition state of both zero and one simultaneously. This means that a set of two qubits can be in a superposition of four states, which therefore require four numbers to uniquely identify the state. So the amount of information stored in N qubits is two to the power of N classical bits.\n\nThank you to Andrea Morello and UNSW.

Getting down to liquid helium temperatures (4K) may be fairly straight forward, but cooling below that requires taking advantage of quantum phenomena.

So I put my own psyche on the line, subjecting myself to over an hour of the most intense quiet on Earth.

Literally. The original name for it was the 'grave', proposed in 1793 but it fell victim to the French Revolution like its creator, Lavoisier. So begins the tale of the most unusual SI unit. The kilogram is the only base unit with a prefix in its name, and the only one still defined by a physical artifact, the international prototype kilogram or IPK.\n\nBut the problem with this definition has long been apparent. The IPK doesn't seem to maintain its mass compared to 40 similar cylinders minted at the same time. The goal is therefore to eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object. Two main approaches are being considered to achieve this end: the Avogadro Project and the Watt Balance.\n\nThe Avogadro project aims to redefine Avogadro's constant (currently defined by the kilogram -- the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12) and reverse the relationship so that the kilogram is precisely specified by Avogadro's constant. This method required creating the most perfect sphere on Earth. It is made out of a single crystal of silicon 28 atoms. By carefully measuring the diameter, the volume can be precisely specified. Since the atom spacing of silicon is well known, the number of atoms in a sphere can be accurately calculated. This allows for a very precise determination of Avogadro's constant.\n\nSpecial thanks to Katie Green, Dr. David Farrant, the CSIRO, and the National Measurment Institute for their help.

But it's not just Australia - it seems like all beautiful, warm places are cursed with venomous native species. So I set out to find the truth: why have all these venomous species evolved in the world's best holiday destinations?\n\nI asked chemists, visited the zoo, interviewed entomologists and snake experts. The answer I found was complicated:\n1. The majority of venomous species are ectotherms, cold-blooded creatures whose internal temperatures are governed by their surroundings.\n2. This means they have limited periods of activity - mainly while it's warm out, and can only exert short bursts of energy, so they are generally \"sit and wait\" predators. This may explain why they, more than mammals or birds, evolved venom.\n3. It also explains why there are more of these species in warm climates. There are more of all species in warm climates, but this trend is especially pronounced for ectotherms.\n4. So there are a greater number of venomous species in warm places, simply because there are more species in warm places. Cold climates still have venomous creatures, like the rattlesnakes of Canada and European vipers.\n5. But history also has a role to play. In Australia, there were no snakes until 20 million years ago when a venomous sea snake from Asia encountered the land, sending venomous species to all corners of the continent. Later non-venomous arrivals have done well in the tropics but not as well in Australia's colder climates, so venomous types still dominate there. Hawaii has no venomous land snakes and nor does Jamaica.\n6. The recent ice age also would have driven ectotherms from the northern parts of the Northern Hemisphere. This is why there are no snakes in Ireland, for example.\n\nSpecial thanks to Prof. Rick Shine, Prof. Dieter Hochuli, Prof. Roger Lowe, Prof. Martyn Poliakoff and Taronga Zoo, especially Joe Haddock and Dean Purcell.\n\nCinematography by Charles Clement Made for ABC TV Catalyst  as an extended version of my Comparing Temperatures video:  Complete unedited interviews: \r\nTrees can weigh hundreds or even thousands of tons, but where do they get this mass from? A few common answers are: the soil, water, and sunlight. But the truth is the vast majority of a dry tree's mass comes from the air - it originated as carbon dioxide The sun has been producing light for about five billion years but where does all its energy come from? The most common idea is that the sun is burning gas - like a giant fireball in the sky. If this were true, the sun would have gone out long ago. So how is the sun actually fuelling itself? It is converting its own mass into energy. By combining protons (the nucleus of hydrogen) into helium, it squeezes some mass into energy - 4.3 billion kg per second. It is Einstein's famous E=mc^2 which gives us the quantitative relationship between mass and energy, where c is the speed of light. Are you heaviest at night before you go to bed and lightest in the morning? I tried to tease out the factors to figure out what really causes weight gain and loss during the day, and what causes daily weight fluctuations.  At the Palais de la Decouverte in Paris, they showed me this experiment where a 1kg aluminium plate is levitated above a large coil of wire that is being supplied with 800A of alternating current at 900Hz. This is by far the best demonstration of electromagnetic induction I have ever seen.\n\nBack in London, I visited the magnetic lab of Michael Faraday in the basement of the Royal Institution. It was here that he did his groundbreaking work on induction. People had previously observed that current in a wire causes a compass needle to deflect, but more exciting was the prospect of using a magnetic field to generate current. Faraday created his famous induction ring by winding two coils of insulated wire onto an iron ring. When he connected a battery to one coil, a small pulse of current was induced in the other. When the battery was disconnected, current was induced in the other direction. This led Faraday to the conclusion that current was induced in the second coil only when the magnetic field through it was changing.\n\nAnd if they hadn't been wrapped on the same ring, Faraday may have noticed that the two coils repel each other when the current is induced due to the interaction of their magnetic fields. This is the same thing that is happening with the aluminium plate, except we're using alternating current to create a continually changing magnetic field. This induces an alternating current in the plate, producing an opposing magnetic field which levitates the disk. Microwave grape plasma: \nNorthern Lights: \nNanodiamonds in candle flames: \nRelight Candle Trick: \n\nIs a flame really a plasma? Well it depends on your definition of plasma, but there are certainly ions in a flame, formed as molecules collide with each other at high speed, sometimes knocking electrons off of their atoms.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Palais de la Decouverte for helping me perform this experiment. Using tens of thousands of volts on two metal plates, we created a strong electric field around the plasma. This pulled positive ions in one direction and negative ions in the other direction elongating the flame horizontally and causing it to flicker like a \"papillon\" (butterfly). Then we showed that much longer sparks can be made through the flame than through air since the ions increase the conductivity. When a grape is cut nearly in half and placed in a microwave, plasma is produced. Please use caution if attempting this experiment: don't leave the microwave on for too long, make sure the area is well ventilated, and stand back. Remember the contents will be very hot afterwards. What happens when you decrease the pressure around a liquid? It boils. Water boils at room temperature once the pressure is low enough. What is interesting is that this decreases the temperature of the liquid. The fastest molecules escape, leaving the slower ones behind.\nUsing this trick with liquid nitrogen, it is possible to create solid nitrogen at a temperature of -210C. We then poured the solid and liquid nitrogen mixture onto a tray of water. The surface of the water became so cold that CO2 solidified out of the atmosphere on its surface. Then, since CO2 does not pass through the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure, it was propelled on the water surface by jets of gas as it sublimed.\nHuge thanks to the Palais de la Decouverte.\nMusic by Kevin MacLeod of Incompetech.com (Mirage) The atmosphere applies a pressure of about 100 000 N to every square metre on Earth's surface. We take this pressure for granted because we have the same amount of pressure pushing out. But what happens when the pressure of the atmosphere is applied to an object with no outward pressure? It implodes. In spectacular fashion.  There seems to be confusion about what radiation is and where it comes from. Many people believe it is the radiation that comes directly from nuclear power plants that poses a threat to public safety. In fact it is the radioactive atoms, which can escape in the event of an explosion, that pose a safety risk. They can be scattered by the wind over hundreds of kilometres. Then they may be ingested or breathed in. If they release radiation at this point, it is damaging to the body's molecules and cells because the radiation is delivered directly to tissues. Most people recognize that atoms are the fundamental building blocks of all matter around us. An atom itself is composed of protons, neutrons and electrons. The simplest atom is the hydrogen atom because it consists of only one proton and one electron. If a neutron is added to the nucleus, the atom is still hydrogen, just a more massive version. Atoms of the same element (i.e. those with the same number of protons) but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. An introduction to alpha, beta, and gamma radiation What is radiation? Are all types harmful? What are the most common sources of damaging radiation? Most people view radiation as harmful and negative without understanding what makes it potentially damaging and which forms should be avoided. For example, many felt radiation from mobile phones probably caused cancer but few focused on the carcinogenic effects of UV rays. Countries are powered by a diverse range of energy sources, but in Australia electricity generation mainly has one source: fossil fuels. Coal, natural gas, and oil account for over 90% of the country's electricity. Hydro provides 7% with only 0.3% provided by wind and solar. Should Australia consider nuclear power? It is a complicated issue leaving many uncertain about its place in Australia's energy future.  The Earth spins on its axis, completing a full revolution every day. By why does it do this? One of the most common misconceptions in physics is the belief that constant motion requires a constant force. So many people believe there must be some force in the Earth (e.g. gravity, centrifugal force) that keeps it spinning. In truth, no force is required because a fundamental property of mass is that it maintains its state of motion in the absence of external forces. This property is called inertia. One of the most common physics misconceptions is that an unbalanced force causes constant motion. In truth, an unbalanced force leads to changes in motion - accelerations. If you've seen footage from the International Space Station or any of the space shuttle missions, you know that astronauts float around as they orbit the Earth. Why is that? Is it because the gravitational force on them is zero in space? (Or nearly zero?) The truth is that the strength of the gravitational attraction is only slightly less than it is on Earth's surface. So how are they able to float? Well, they aren't floating - they're falling, along with the space station. They don't crash into the Earth because they have a huge orbital velocity. So as they accelerate towards the Earth, the Earth curves away beneath them and they never get any closer. Since the astronauts have the same acceleration as the space station, they feel weightless. It's like being in a free-falling elevator (without the disastrous landing).\n\nDirector of Photography: Stefan Smith\nCamera Assistant: Raa Perajeev\nBoom Operator: Maha Sivalingam\n\nProduction Coordinator: Adrian Tan\nProduction Assistants: James Peniata, Pratheep Ramachandran Newton's Three Laws of Motion are a landmark achievement in physics. They describe how all objects move. Unfortunately most people do not really understand Newton's Laws because they have pre-existing ideas about the way the world works. This film is about those pre-existing ideas. By recognizing what people are thinking, it becomes easier to describe the correct scientific concepts of Newton's Three Laws and how they differ from this 'intuitive physics'. A basketball and a 5kg medicine ball are dropped simultaneously. Which one hits the ground first? It seems obvious that the heavy one should accelerate at a greater rate and therefore land first because the force pulling it down is greater. But this is forgetting inertia - the tendency of mass to resist changes in motion.

We discover the surprising answer using a slow motion camera that records 300 frames per second. Answer link: \n\nFor a great explanation, check out Rhett Allain's analysis here:  This is how a slinky falls in slow motion - it appears to defy gravity but the centre of mass is accelerating at 9.8m/s^2 meaning the top is accelerating faster than that and the bottom is not falling at all until the entire slinky collapses.\n\nRead a pre-print of the physics paper here: \nMusic by Kevin McLeod \nSongs: Industrial Music Box, Heavy Interlude, Pale Rider, Decisions.\n\nSlow motion photography courtesy of Questacon \n\nThe original goal of Veritasium was to show the beauty of science and I think the first minute and a half of this is the closest I've come. This is the last in a series of six videos about slinkies. What happens when a super long slinky is dropped?

At that time, both federal spending would be reduced and tax cuts would expire, which experts feared would harm the already-fragile US economy by taking a great deal of money out of circulation. Congress passed a budget compromise within 24 hours of the \"fiscal cliff,\" but the compromise only delayed dealing with the issue, which reemerged with the debt-ceiling crisis of October 2013.

In this video, Kim discusses the problems that prevented England from following in Spain's footsteps, including struggles for the throne, war in Ireland, and economic depression. In the late 1500s and early 1600s, the United Kingdom cast its gaze westward and joined the quest for American colonies. In this video, Kim discusses the motivations for English colonization, including competition with Catholic nations for riches and souls, and the development of 'joint-stock' companies. Kim and David discuss the mystery of the \"Lost Colony\" on Roanoke Island, the English settlement in North America that vanished in the late 1500s. In this video, Kim and David set the stage for the colonial venture and discuss the first two missions to Roanoke Island. Kim and David continue discussing the Lost Colony of Roanoke. What happened when the English colonists finally settled on the coast of North Carolina? What are the prevailing theories about what happened to the colonists?

Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. \nFor the BBQ sauce, heat oil in a large pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add poblano chile, red onion, garlic, ginger, and a pinch of salt, then cook until onions begin to soften. Add the remaining sauce ingredients and bring the mixture to a simmer. Turn the heat down to medium-low and cook at an active simmer until the mixture is reduced to about 2 cups, about 30-45 minutes. \nOnce reduced, cool slightly then transfer mixture to a blender. Puree until smooth. \nPreheat oven to 275\u02daF/140\u02daC. \nUncover the ribs, keeping them raised over the baking sheet on the wire rack. Pour 2 cups of water into the bottom of the baking sheet. \nSpread 1 cup of the BBQ sauce over each rack of ribs. \nBake in a preheated oven for 3-3 \u00bd hours. \nRemove ribs from oven and preheat the broiler to high. \nBroil the ribs for 5-10 minutes to finish, until the sauce caramelizes. \nCut into individual ribs.\nEnjoy!\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits:  Check 'Red Rooster Cookbook' here: \n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nFRIED CHICKEN by Marcus Samuelsson \nServes 8\n\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups water\n1 cup coarse kosher salt\n6 cups cold ice water \n4 chicken thighs\n4 chicken drumsticks\n2 cups buttermilk\n\u00be cup coconut milk\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tablespoon chicken shake*, plus additional for serving\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n\u00bc cup semolina flour\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 tablespoon white pepper\nPeanut oil for frying\n\n*CHICKEN SHAKE\n\u00bc cup berbere\n\u00bc cup hot smoked paprika\n2 tablespoons ground cumin\n2 tablespoons white pepper\n2 tablespoons celery salt\n1 \u00bd teaspoons granulated garlic\n1 \u00bd teaspoons coarse kosher salt\n\nPREPARATION\nIn a medium saucepan over high heat, add 2 cups of water and the salt. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve all the salt. Remove from heat and pour into a larger pot/container.\nAdd the ice water into the pot to cool. Add the chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 1 \u00bd hours. \nPrepare the chicken shake. In a small bowl, whisk together all the chicken shake ingredients. Makes about 1 cup that will keep for 6 months. Store in a jar out of the light. \nIn a 9x13-inch baking dish, whisk together buttermilk, coconut milk, garlic, and 1 tablespoon of chicken shake. Remove the chicken from the saltwater, dab on paper towels to remove excess liquid, then add into the buttermilk marinade. Roll to coat each piece. Cover and refrigerate overnight. \nFill a large cast iron pan \u2154-full with peanut oil over medium-high heat. Heat to 360\u02daF. \nWhile the oil is heating, coat the marinated chicken. In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, cornstarch, and white pepper. Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off, then roll in the flour mixture, packing it on so the chicken is completely coated. Set coated chicken on a wire rack over a baking sheet. If the coating looks damp, roll it in the flour mixture again. \nWorking in batches, fry the chicken until it is brown and golden on both sides and reaches an internal temperature of 165\u02daF, about 10 minutes per batch. Adjust heat to keep the oil between 350-375\u02daF. Drain on a rack set over a baking sheet. Rest 8-10 minutes. Fry the chicken a second time, only for about 3 minutes, to really crisp up the skin. Drain on a rack.\nSprinkle with additional chicken shake. \nEnjoy! \n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nReal Love\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nMade by BFMP www.buzzfeed.com/videoteam.

If necessary, use a knife to trim the edges and place the trimmings back on top of the butter and continue to roll into a square. \nTransfer the butter layer to the refrigerator.  \nTo roll out the dough, lightly flour the counter. Place the dough on the counter, and push the rolling pin once vertically into the dough and once horizontally to form four quadrants. \nRoll out each corner and form a 10-inch square. \nPlace the butter layer on top of the dough and fold the sides of the dough over the butter, enclosing it completely. \nRoll the dough with a rolling pin to seal the seams, making sure to lengthen the dough, rather than widening it.  \nTransfer the dough to a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.\nRoll out the dough on a floured surface until it\u2019s 8x24 inches. \nFold the top half down to the middle, and brush off any excess flour.\nFold the bottom half over the top and turn the dough clockwise to the left. This completes the first turn. \nRefrigerate for one hour. \nRoll out the dough again two more times, completing three turns in total and refrigerating for 1 hour in between each turn. If at anytime the dough or butter begins to soften, stop and transfer back to the fridge.  \nAfter the final turn, cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. \nTo form the croissants, cut the dough in half. Place one half in the refrigerator. \nFlour the surface and roll out the dough into a long narrow strip, about 8x40 inches. \nWith a knife, trim the edges of the dough. \nCut the dough into 4 rectangles. \nPlace the chocolate on the edge of the dough and roll tightly enclosing it in the dough. \nPlace the croissants on a baking sheet, seam side down. \nRepeat with the other half of the dough. \nBrush the croissants with the beaten egg. Save the rest of the egg wash in the fridge for later.\nPlace the croissants in a warm place to rise for 1-2 hours. \nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\nOnce the croissants have proofed, brush them with one more layer of egg wash. \nBake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. \nEnjoy warm! \n\nInspired by: \n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: \n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network Reserve the One Top: \n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: \n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network  Sweet, salty and umami, you won't regret trying this chifa-style chaufa by Santos Loo.

Used with permission Make your own happy hour. Cheers!\n\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:\n\n1 lb strawberries\n1 lb kiwis\n1 cup light rum\n1 bottle white wine (such as sauvignon blanc)\n1 bottle sparkling wine, chilled (such as cava)\n1 cup sugar\n1 cup water\n3 oranges\na pitcher or other large container\n\nDirections:\n\nHull the strawberries and cut them in half. Peel the kiwis and cut them into slices.\n\nCombine half of the halved strawberries, the sugar and water in a saucepan and turn the heat up to medium. Bring the mixture up to a boil and then let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the strawberries seem like they\u2019re about to fall apart. Let cool for a few minutes, and then, using a mesh sieve, strain the strawberry goodness into a bowl. Use a spoon to press the strawberries up against the mesh so you get every last beautiful drop of strawberry syrup. Place the syrup in the refrigerator to cool a bit.\n\nCombine the kiwi slices and the remaining strawberries in a pitcher, and add the rum, white wine, strawberry syrup, and the juice of three oranges (in a pinch, you could also sub a few splashes of bottled orange juice, or even lemonade, for the fresh orange juice). Give it all a good stir and then pop the pitcher in the refrigerator for at least four hours to let all of the flavors come together.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to serve, add around three-quarters of the chilled sparkling wine to the pitcher. Pour into glasses and spoon in fruit, topping each glass off with a bit of the remaining champagne so it\u2019s nice a bubbly when you hand the glass to a friend.

Tasty pure meat sausages slow cooked in a rich cider stew with carrots, chunks of swede and mixed herbs. The perfect dish to dive in to this Autumn!\n\nThis and loads more delicious recipes can be found in their book The Art of Eating Well available here: \n\nOr check out their website \n\nIf you want to make this stew arm yourself with the following ingredients: \n\n2 tbsp ghee\n10 large gluten-free* sausages\n2 medium onions, diced\n2 medium leeks, sliced\n4 garlic cloves, diced\n3 celery sticks, diced\n500ml dry organic cider (no added sugar)\n2tbsp tomato puree\n2 tbsp mustard\n3 large pinches dried herbs ( or double if using fresh)\n2 dried bay leaves\n2 large handfuls fresh parsley\n500ml bone broth (or vegetable stock)\n2 swedes peeled and diced\n4 large carrots roughly chopped\nsea salt & black pepper\n\nMethod:\n\nHeat 1 tablespoon of the ghee in a large pan or casserole dish over a medium heat. Brown the sausages for about 30 seconds on each side, then set the sausages aside.You might need to do this in two batches to avoid overcrowding, otherwise they will start to steam rather than brown.\nIn the same pan, heat the remaining ghee over a medium heat and add the onions, leeks, garlic and celery. Saute\u0301 for 5 minutes or more until soft.\nAdd the tomato pure\u0301e, mustard and herbs, including the parsley stalk ends but not the fresh parsley leaves, and stir.\nAdd the broth or stock and bring to the boil.Throw in the rest of the vegetables, cover the pan, reduce the heat to a medium simmer and cook for 30 minutes or more until the vegetables are tender.\nPour in the cider to deglaze the pan, turn up the heat and let it bubble away until it reduces. Use a wooden spatula to scrape the bottom of the pan and release any caramelised, browned bits.\nMeanwhile, slice each sausage into thirds at an angle and add to the pan for the last 15 minutes of cooking. Season to taste with sea salt and pepper.\nAdd more liquid for a soupier stew or cook without a lid for a thicker, richer sauce if preferred. Alternatively, remove some of the sauce and vegetables and blend to make a thick, creamy sauce before stirring it back into the pan. Stir in the parsley leaves to serve.\n\n*Traditionally sausages contain a rusk filler to bulk them out made up of wheat and other bulking agents - we choose gluten free to ensure a higher meat content and at the same time we avoid the rusk filler. \n\nSee more Hemsley + Hemsley videos on Jasmine and Melissa's channel here: \n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/HemsleyHemsley\n@hemsleyhemsley\n#TheArtOfEatingWell\n\nLinks from the Video:\nScallopsTartare | \n\nJamie Oliver's Food Tube | \nSubscribe to Food Tube | \nTwitter: \nJamie's Recipes App | \nTumblr: \nFacebook | \nMore great recipes | \n\n#FOODTUBE\n\nx Hello lovely peoples of YouTubes!

This is especially important after exercise so that our muscles can repair and grow.\n+Drinking a smoothie like this is better than your average energy drink because it provides just as much energy and sugar but it also provides your body with other nutrients like fibre and vitamins & minerals which are needed when you work hard at the gym.\n\nThe % breakdown of bananas Tim talks about is the approximate contribution of the energy from different macronutritents.\n\nWhat do you put in YOUR work-out smoothies Food Tubers?\nWant to see more exercise & health-related videos?\nWhat about vegan recipes?\nTell us all of the above in the comments box below.

Soak in cold water for 5 minutes until they curl up, then drain and place on top of the chicken.\n\nSprinkle on a teaspoon of chopped spring onions, a couple of sliced chillies, 3 or 4 stems of sweet basil and a handful of dried shallots.\n\nLastly squeeze 1/4 of lime into the broth to balance the flavours and serve with a hoisin and Sriracha dipping sauce.\n\n\nJamie Oliver's Food Tube | \nSubscribe to Food Tube | \nTwitter: \nJamie's Recipes App | \nTumblr: \nFacebook | \nMore great recipes | \n\n#FOODTUBE\n\nx A traditional recipe for an occasional treat, this is Food Busker John Quilter's Vietnamese Iced Coffee, or 'C\u00e0 ph\u00ea s\u1eefa \u0111\u00e1'.

Got any suggestion of an amazing food market near you. Let me know in the box below.\n\nFor business enquiries: ftbusiness@freshone.tv\n\nIngredients\n2 flank steaks\n3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped\n3 shallots, peeled and diced\nJuice \u00bd a lemon\n1 tbsp. sherry vinegar\nVirgin olive oil (lemon infused if available)\nSmall handful of sage\nHandful of flat leaf parsley\n2 dried habanero chillies\n1 red onion\n1 large baguette, cut into 6-inch subs\nChimichurri sauce to serve (easily made by blitzing together garlic cloves, diced shallots, lemon juice, sherry vinegar, olive oil and chilli flakes in a mini food processor)\n\nMethod\nLay out the steaks in a shallow roasting tin. In a pestle and mortar, grind the garlic and shallots together to form a rough paste, then evenly spoon over the steaks. Squeeze over the juice of half a lemon, and pour over the sherry vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil. \n\nRemove the stalks from the sage and finely chop the leaves with the parsley. Sprinkle over the steaks. Finely dice the dried chillies and add to the mix too.\n\nWith the back of a spoon, mix the steaks with the marinade ingredients, pushing them into the flesh and coating the steaks. If you have time, cover and leave to marinade in the fridge for 2-3 hours.\n\nHalve and finely slice the red onion into disks and set aside. Heat a griddle pan over a very high heat.\n\nPlace the steaks on the hot griddle \u2013 there should be an audible sizzle \u2013 with the red onion slices around them. After 45 seconds, flip the steaks, and cook on the other side for 1\u00bd minutes. Remove the meat and onions from the pan and onto a wooden chopping board. Cover with tin foil and rest. \n\nMeanwhile, slice the baguettes open horizontally, drizzle with olive oil, and place face down on the griddle pan until golden.\n\nFirmly slice the steak into strips with a sharp knife, and season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Load into the baguettes, topping with the red onions and chimichurri sauce. Aaron's back!

Then clean under a cold tap and peel the blackened outer layer.\n\nIn a dry pan roast the spices on a medium heat for 2 minutes.\n\nBring 3 litres of water to boil and add the whole chicken, the daikon and the roasted onions and ginger.  Place the roasted spices into a strainer and position carefully at the bottom of the pot.  Lower the heat and simmer for 1 hour.\n\nOnce an hour has passed remove all the ingredients from the pot and carefully remove the foam from the surface of the broth. \n\nPlace the chicken to one side to cool.  \n\nAdd the fish sauce, salt and sugar to the broth and leave to simmer for a further 30 minutes.\n\nSoak the pho noodles in lukewarm water for 20 minutes.  Drain and place into a pot of boiling water for 3 minutes.  Drain well and leave to cool.\n\nTake a handful of noodles and place into a bowl, adding a small handful of bean sprouts.  Tear the chicken into large chunks and place on top.  Now pour the broth into the bowl laving a small amount of room for the herbs.\n\nRemove the top and bottom of the spring onions and slice very thinly lengthwise.  Soak in cold water for 5 minutes until they curl up, then drain and place on top of the chicken.\n\nSprinkle on a teaspoon of chopped spring onions, a couple of sliced chillies, 3 or 4 stems of sweet basil and a handful of dried shallots.\n\nLastly squeeze 1/4 of lime into the broth to balance the flavours and serve with a hoisin and Sriracha dipping sauce.\n\n\nJamie Oliver's Food Tube | \nSubscribe to Food Tube | \nTwitter: \nJamie's Recipes App | \nTumblr: \nFacebook | \nMore great recipes | \n\n#FOODTUBE\n\nx Chicken nuggets are a much loved family favourite and Jamie\u2019s got a recipe for quick and healthy nuggets made from real breast meat that you\u2019ll feel good feeding to your kids.

Mix with fingers until just combined, and sprinkle with water.  Knead until a sticky dough forms.  Turn out onto a lightly floured tabletop, and knead rigorously (slap onto the table about 100 times), until the dough is soft and supple.  Place in a lightly oiled bowl and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\nCombine apples, sugar, lemon zest, raisins, and cinnamon.  Set aside and let liquid weep from apples.\n\nCover a large table with a cotton tablecloth, and liberally dust with flour.  Roll out dough on tablecloth until about 24\" in diameter, and using floured fists, stretch dough out as large as possible without tearing.  Back on the tablecloth, gently tug at edges of dough until it's a rectangle thin enough to see the pattern of the tablecloth underneath.  Trim off torn/thick edges.  Drizzle with melted butter, and brush until evenly coated.  Sprinkle with chopped nuts.\n\nPlace about 3/4 of apple mixture on one side of the dough rectangle, and using the tablecloth, roll the apples over onto the dough square.  Brush the newly-exposed dough covering the apples with melted butter.  Roll apples over again, and repeat, until apples are at the center of a long, closed roll.

Can such familiar ingredients earn such a prestigious moniker?  Let's find out, and let's take it one step further: by baking our own rustic country loaf to act as the \"bread\" for our creation.  Recipe below!\n\nMusic: \"Cream on Chrome\" by Ratatat\n\nWatch in Spanish here: \n\nRECIPE\n\n--\n\n*Ingredients*\n\n1c room temperature wtaer\n1/2 tsp instant yeast\n5.5 oz bread flour\n5 oz whole wheat flour\n19.25 oz bread flour\n2.75 oz rye flour\n1 1/3c room temperature water\n2 tbsp honey\n2 tsp salt\n\n*Method*\n\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer, make a sponge - combine water and yeast until dissolved. Add first two flours and roughly mix, until a tight dough forms. Cover and let rest ferment at room temperature for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.\n\nAdd remaining flours, water, and honey to the sponge, and mix until combined. Attach dough hook to stand mixer, and knead on low speed for 15 minutes, until dough is loose and sticky. Add salt during last 3 minutes of mixing. Remove from bowl, place in a large oiled tub, cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 2 hours, until tripled in size.\n\nPreheat oven to 450F, with a pizza stone on the middle rack, and a metal pan you don't care about on the rack below. On a well-floured work surface, turn out dough. Fold four corners into the center of the dough, and place in a cheese-cloth lined colander or banneton, and let rise for 45 minutes, or until almost doubled in size. Invert onto a pizza peel lined with parchment paper. Bring two cups of water to a boil. Just before placing in the oven, slash the dough and spray the surface with water from a spray bottle. Slide onto the pizza stone, and pour boiling water into the preheated pan below, closing the oven door immediately. Bake for 35-45 minutes, turning halfway through if not browning evenly - remove from oven when internal temperature registers 210F. Let rest a minimum of 2 hours before slicing.\n\nBinging With Babish Website: \nBasics With Babish Website: \nPatreon: \nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nTwitter:   Reverse-sear with bonus butter baste.

Once toasted, place in the bowl of a food processor.  Process for 2-3 minutes, until peppers are reduced to a fine powder.  Add cocoa, corn flour, cumin, and oregano - pulse to combine.  While machine runs, add 3/4 cup of chicken stock, until a paste is formed.  Scrape into a bowl and set aside.\n\nHeat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large pot until near-smoking.  In batches, brown beef on all sides, being careful not to over-crowd the pot.  Once all beef has browned, and fond has formed on the bottom of the pot, add remaining oil, and saut\u00e9 onions and peppers until sweating.  Deglaze with beer, and scrape the bottom of the pot.  Add remaining ingredients, stir well, and place in a 300F oven, lid slightly ajar.  Stir occasionally to prevent scorching, and braise for 2-3 hours, until beef is tender.  Season with salt and pepper, and serve with cheese and cornbread.  Remy is an especially-clean-looking rat that's been given the gift of Gusteau's gastronomy.

Mix with fingers until just combined, and sprinkle with water.  Knead until a sticky dough forms.  Turn out onto a lightly floured tabletop, and knead rigorously (slap onto the table about 100 times), until the dough is soft and supple.  Place in a lightly oiled bowl and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\nCombine apples, sugar, lemon zest, raisins, and cinnamon.  Set aside and let liquid weep from apples.\n\nCover a large table with a cotton tablecloth, and liberally dust with flour.  Roll out dough on tablecloth until about 24\" in diameter, and using floured fists, stretch dough out as large as possible without tearing.  Back on the tablecloth, gently tug at edges of dough until it's a rectangle thin enough to see the pattern of the tablecloth underneath.  Trim off torn/thick edges.  Drizzle with melted butter, and brush until evenly coated.  Sprinkle with chopped nuts.\n\nPlace about 3/4 of apple mixture on one side of the dough rectangle, and using the tablecloth, roll the apples over onto the dough square.  Brush the newly-exposed dough covering the apples with melted butter.  Roll apples over again, and repeat, until apples are at the center of a long, closed roll.  Pinch ends together to seal contents inside, and place seam-side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Brush liberally with a beaten egg.\n\nBake for about an hour, basting with melted butter every 10-15 minutes, as soon as the crust begins to look dry.  Remove from oven when golden brown.

I've been making this simple but delicious sandwich for years and years, even when I lived in Korea. Western-style sandwiches are popular in Korea for lunchbox items. \u00a0Every time I made them my friends in Korea wanted to know the recipe, and as you see in the video my friends in LA like them, too!\n\nSpecial thankyou to my sandwich tasters!\n\nScooter:\n\n\nHazel:\n\n\nBrodie:\n\n\nCasey:\n \r\nTanya has her own channel on YouTube! Visit her channel to learn delicious recipes!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first video in my Gapshida series that features a recipe from one of my readers. The first destination on my Gapshida tour was to visit Tanja Rogers in Canterbury, England.\r\n\r\nShe's been one of my readers for a long time, and she invited me to her house to share some traditional Thai recipes that she learned from her mother. For this salad she replaced papaya with swede (also known as rutabaga) because it's not easy for her to find a firm green papaya where she lives. When made with swede, this salad tastes almost the same as if it were made with papaya.\r\n\r\nDirections:\r\n1. Roughly crush a small handful of unsalted peanuts\u00a0with mortar and pestle. Set aside. Wipe the mortar and pestle clean.\r\n\r\n2. Melt palm sugar in a small pan at low or medium heat, adding 2 tbs of water. The cooking process should form a shiny and thick syrup. This makes it easier to mix the sugar with the salad.\r\n\r\n3. Peel the papaya (or swede), shred it with a shredder (or a mandolin slicer) to thin stripes and soak them in cold water while you prepare the rest of the salad. This makes the papaya crunchier and gets rid of any excess starch from the swede.\r\n\r\n4. Cut the green beans into one-inch pieces. Throw away the endings.\r\n\r\n5. Take the chilies and peeled garlic and give them a gentle bash with mortar and pestle. You still ought to see bits and pieces, not a puree. Add the shrimps and continue bashing. Add the crushed peanuts and mix well.\r\n\r\n6. Add the shredded papaya and continue bashing, but not too hard. Just enough so the mixture soaks up the flavours. Use a bigger table spoon as a support tool, that way you can shift the salad in the mortar and it doesn't fall out while bashing and mixing.\r\n\r\n7. Add the liquid palm sugar, tomatoes, beans, lime juice and fish sauce. Continue to lightly bash, shift with the spoon, and mix a little more.\r\n\r\n8. Serve on a big dish or bowl, sprinkle some crushed peanuts on top! Voila!\u2028\r\n\r\nIn Thailand it's usually served with sticky rice and along another dish called\u00a0larb, a spice minced meat salad with raw vegetables. \r\n\r\nMariska has her own channel on YouTube! Visit her channel to learn delicious recipes! \r\n\r\nThis is a recipe for Indonesian Gado-gado from Mariska, filmed in Jakarta as part of my Gapshida project. There are all kinds of Korean food fans there! Enjoy!\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n(for 2 servings)\r\n1 thinly sliced medium sized fresh cucumber, 2 fried tempeh (soybean patties), 2 pieces of fried tofu, and a hard boiled egg cut into 4 pieces.\r\n\r\nFor blanched vegetables:\r\n1 cup of string beans cut into 4 cm long pieces, 1 cup of shredded cabbage, 1 cup of mung bean sprouts, 2 small chayotes cut into wedges (2 cups' worth), 1 cup of water spinach (\"ong choy\"), 1 cup of Chinese spinach\r\n \r\nFor the sauce:\r\nground roasted peanuts, bird's eye chilis, dried shrimp paste (terasi), palm sugar, salt, tamarind, and water\r\n\r\nFor garnish:\r\nfried shallots, shrimp crackers, emping (gnetum gnemon chips called \"Melinjo\" in Indonesian)\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n1 medium sized steamed potato cut into bite size pieces\r\n\r\nDirections\r\n1. Blanch and strain Chinese spinach, water spinach, string beans, mung bean sprouts, cabbage and slice 1 cucumber.\r\n \r\nMake sauce using a mortar and pestle\r\n(cooking time: 20-30 minutes)\r\n\r\n1. Grind these ingredients with a mortar and pestle until they're smooth: 1 ts salt, 2 ts dried shrimp paste, 3 red bird's eye chilis, and \u00bc cup's worth of palm sugar.\r\n2. Add 1 cup of finely ground roasted peanuts (or 1 cup of peanut butter) and grind it all some more until it's mixed well. If you use peanut butter instead of ground roasted peanuts, add less salt because there's salt in the peanut butter.\r\n3. Mix 1 tbs (about 20 grams) of tamarind with \u00bc cup of hot water in a small bowl. Add the juice to the sauce.\r\n4. Add \u00bd cup of water and mix it well.\r\n5. Transfer the vegetables to a serving plate and pour the sauce on top of it or mix all the vegetables with the sauce in the mortar before serving.\r\n6. Add a sliced hard-boiled egg on top and garnish with fried shallots, shrimp crackers and emping.\r\n7. Serve with steamed rice.\r\n \r\nOr make sauce using a food processor\r\n(cooking time: 15-20 minutes)\r\n\r\n1. Grind 1 ts salt, 2 ts dried shrimp paste, 3 red bird's eye chilis, and \u00bc cup's worth of palm sugar in a food processor until smooth.\r\n2. In a bowl, mix the blanched vegetables with the sauce. Transfer to a serving plate.\r\n3. Garnish with fried shallots, shrimp crackers, and emping.\r\n4. Serve with steamed rice. The first video from my Gapshida project, filmed in New Zealand with Jamie Frater. The full recipe is on my website: \r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\nChicken gizzards, salt, ground black pepper, vegetable oil, ginger, starch powder, flour, sweet rice flour, baking soda\r\n\r\nDirections:\r\nFor 2 -3 servings\r\nCooking time:  30 minutes\r\n\r\nPrepare 250 grams (\u00bd pound) of chicken gizzards\r\n\r\nSeparate the gizzards into 2 pieces by cutting out the connecting muscle of each gizzard. Trim the excess fat and muscle on each piece to make a ball the size of an olive.\r\nWash and drain in a colander.\r\n\r\nMake batter:\r\nMix 4 tbs (\u00bc cup) starch powder, 3 tbs flour, 1 tbs sweet rice flour, \u00bc ts salt, 1 large egg, and a pinch of baking soda in a bowl.\r\nTip: The batter will seem a little dry, but when it's mixed with the wet gizzards and olives it will become perfectly crispy\r\n\r\nFry:\r\nAdd 7 canned whole and pitted olives to the gizzards. Mix in 1 tbs flour.\r\nPut the gizzards and olives into the batter and mix well with a spoon.\r\nHeat the vegetable oil (about 3 cups) to 350 degrees F.\r\n*tip: Test if the oil is ready by dropping a sample chunk of chicken gizzard into the oil. If the oil bubbles, it's the right temperature to start frying.\r\nUse 2 spoons to put the gizzards into the hot oil. One spoon to scoop out each coated gizzard ball, and another spoon to push it off the first spoon and into the oil.\r\nDeep fry over medium high heat about for 10 minutes until golden brown and crispy.\r\nServe hot or at room temperature with the dipping sauce.\r\n\r\nMake dipping sauce:\r\nGrind 1 tbs roasted sesame seeds and put into a bowl.\r\nAdd 2-3 tbs mayonnaise, juice from half a freshly squeezed lemon, 1 ts soy sauce, and \u00bd ts-1 ts honey to your taste.\r\nMix it well.

Check our more detailed report! love you! \nInteresting people, best dishes, the most comfortable place, awesome hosts, and nice weather, what more do we need to make us happy?\n\nEveryone had a great time, and I have to give a big thanks to our hosts Ashley and Jeff, who invited us into their lovely home.

Maangchi's meetup in Buena Park, California on September 21, 2010. \nOn May 19, 2012 we had a springtime meetup in Connecticut. I was so excited  that I couldn't sleep much the night before, just like a young child. On the Saturday morning I got up early and prepared the last things I needed before going.\n\nFirst I'd like to thank the meetup organizers Kristi and Ryan. We exchanged many emails and met via Google+ hangout to plan the event. Without their help, the event would not have been possible. Thank you so much for your time and effort Kristi and Ryan!\n\nSecondly, I'd like to thank all of those who came to the meetup. Some took a chartered bus with me and some came by their own transportation. Some people came from other states like New Hampshire and Rhode Island which took 4-5 hours! Since it was a potluck picnic, all of them woke up very early in the morning and made or packed fresh food to bring all the way to the meetup.\n\nThere are definitely some common points among everyone who came to the meetup. All of them love good and delicious food and love to cook homemade food the best. Having a potluck party is natural for a group like this. I can add 1 more important ingredient that made us connect to each other instantly: passion!  Let me introduce you to a popular Korean street snack gyeran-ppang (\uacc4\ub780\ube75) or \"egg bread\" today. This is a sweet, steamy, hot and fluffy little loaf of bread with a whole egg inside. It's sold by street vendors all over Korea.\nFull recipe: \n\nUntil recently, I had never had gyeran-ppang before. Many of my readers who had travelled to Korea requested it on my recipe request forum, so when I went to Korea last November, tasting gyeran-ppang was on my list of things to do, a kind of mission. I wanted to taste it so I could make a recipe video for it.\n\nIt was definitely delicious, and I could see why so many of my readers requested it!\n\nMore recipes in my cookbook:  Full recipe: \nToday I\u2019m going to show you how to make a Korean street snack called yachae-hotteok. Yachae means \u201cvegetables\u201d in Korean, and hotteok are pancakes usually stuffed with sweet stuff and nuts. But in this case they\u2019re filled with savory noodles and chopped vegetables.

Each bite is succulent and wonderful!\n\nOi means \u201ccucumber\u201d in English, and muchim means \u201cmixed\u201d or \u201cseasoned,\u201d so many people simply call this dish \u201cseasoned cucumber\u201d.  Many Koreans have their own version of it, so you\u2019ll find many variations from family to family. This one is mine, and I\u2019ve been using it for a long time. It\u2019s also one of the dishes in my cookbook.\n\nA major tip for this recipe is to make it and mix it just before serving, which will keep it crisp and fresh and prevent it from getting watery.

For many Koreans an easy, simple everyday meal consists of rice, kimchi, a stew (often doenjang-jjigae), kongnamul-muchim (a bean sprout side dish), and sigeumchi-namul. Today's recipe is dubu-jorim (spicy braised tofu). It's fresh tofu braised in a savory-spicy sauce and pan fried with caramelized onion, garlic, and green onions, making it juicy, a little spicy, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It's a delicious side dish for rice, noodles or porridge, and tastes meaty even though it's a totally vegetarian dish.\nThe full recipe is here! \nMy cookbook!  \n\nGaji-namul is a simple, delicious, everyday Korean side dish, meant to be eaten with other side dishes and rice.\n\nIt\u2019s one of my favorites.

Put the kimchi into a container, jar, or plastic bag.\r\n8. Press the top of the kimchi down with your hands to protect your kimchi from being exposed to too much air.\r\n9. You can eat it right away, just like salad. Or keep it at room temperature and it will ferment in a few days. Fermented kimchi can be used for kimchi stir-fried rice orkimchi stew, and it will be delicious. The recipe is here: \n\nCucumber kimchi (oi-sobagi) is made by turning a cucumber into a pocket and stuffing it with vegetables and kimchi paste. It's delicious and refreshing and it's a great kimchi to make when cucumbers are in season and you don't feel like waiting for your kimchi to ferment. You can eat this right away: they're cool, spicy, and crunchy. Cucumber kimchi is a good example of a kimchi that doesn't have to be fermented to be great.\n\nIt's  been a very popular recipe on my website ever since I first posted it. However my original video used copyright-protected music ('A Message to You, Rudy' by The Specials), and the sound was recently removed by the copyright holder. Many people have been asking me to remake the video, so with cucumbers in season it's a good time to do it. Enjoy the updated video!\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 pounds kirby cucumbers (9 or 10 cucumbers) or 4 4\u00bd inch long small, thin cucumbers.\n2 tablespoons salt\n1 cup buchu (Asian chives), chopped into \u00bd inch pieces\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n1 medium carrot, cut into thin matchsticks (about 1 cup)\n1 cup onion, sliced thinly\n\u00bd cup hot pepper flakes\n3 tablespoons fish sauce\n1 tablespoon sugar\n\u00bc cup water\n1 tablespoon sesame seeds How to make easy kimchi (\"mak kimchi\" in Korean).\nfull recipe: \nIt's made with small pieces of cabbage that are easier to handle and take less time to prepare.

(Did you know JAPANESE VENDING MACHINES?!) So we've been trying to collect interesting facts about Japan that are actually true for years, and we finally reached 50!\n\nThis video took the most time to make out of all our videos so far--more than 250 hours!! We put weeks into researching facts, tossing ones that either weren't true or as interesting as we first thought, and verifying the necessary ones with statistics from official sources (do you know the pain\u2026 of trying to translate 100+ page government reports\u2026). Those sources are in the description box. We called agencies to ask them questions directly. We visited museums. We drove all over the place and filmed a lot of B roll (oh so much B roll). So here it is, basically everything we know about Japan (well, maybe not everything). Some of you may recognize a couple facts in here that we've talked about in past videos! I really hope you guys enjoy this video!!\n\nThank you so much to all the people who upload images, sounds and EVEN VIDEO OF A RARE CAT HOLY CRAP to Wikipedia!! You\u2019re the real MVP.

It might be a bit overkill but it's probably easier than searching specifically for soft water.\n** Add more nigari or lemon juice if necessary\n\n\uff0dSukiyaki Sauce\uff0d\n100ml sake\n100ml mirin\n100ml soy sauce\n30g granulated sugar\n\n\uff0dVegetables\uff0d\nYou can use any vegetables you like. Here'are the ones I used this time\n\ngreen onion\nChinese cabbage\nshiitake mushroom\ncarrot\nthread konjac\nvery thin, marbled beef slices\n \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-Tofu-\n1. Soak the soybeans in water(1200ml). The soaking time depends on the water temperature. \n\nSummer: 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F 10 hours\nSpring, Autumn: 15\u00b0C/59\u00b0F 20 hours\nWinter: 5\u00b0C/41\u00b0F 30 hours\n\n2. Blend the soybeans and water in a mixer to make namago. (Namago is the Japanese word for that specific blended mixture of soybeans and water).\n3. Boil 1600ml water in a large pan or pot and add the namago and stir for about 10 minutes. Make sure not to burn the namago at the bottom of the pan.\n4. Turn off the heat and strain the namago with a filter cloth to get soy milk. The leftover is called okara and it's very healthy. I normally use it for making cookies. \n5. Mix 20ml nigari (or lemon juice) and 50ml water together to make the coagulant for the soy milk.\n\n(\"Your coagulant is a substance that will curdle the soy milk. You can use acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, or salt. Nigari, which is magnesium chloride, is popular in Japan, and calcium chloride is popular in North America.\"\n-huffingtonpost)\n\n6. Heat up the soy milk and keep the temperature at 75\u00b0C. Add the nigari-water and stir gently. Do NOT mix too much.  Turn off the heat and leave it for about 10 minutes.\n7. While resting the soy milk, prepare a container for shaping the tofu. You can make holes in the bottom of a paper drink carton or tupperware, or you can just use your filter cloth and tie it up tighly to shapen the tofu as well.\n\n-Sukiyaki Sauce-\n\n1. Add 100ml sake and 100ml mirin in a pot and boil it.\n2. Add the sugar and soy sauce, and let the sugar melt.\n\n-Sukiyaki-\n1. Melt the beef fat* (or just some slices of fatty beef) and cook the green onion (if you have it) in the sukiyaki pot to add flavor to the sauce. Green onion tastes so much sweeter and more flavorful when you fry it first. \n2. Add the sauce and heat it up. Then add tofu, konjac, mushrooms, and anything that takes longer to cook than your other vegetables.\n3. Finally, place everything else.\n\nSukiyaki is a shared Japanese dish where everyone ladles out some of the broth and food into their own bowls. Traditionally, sukiyaki is eaten with a raw beaten egg added to your own bowl, but that might be difficult for you depending on how safe raw eggs are considered where you live. I normally don't eat it with egg so I can enjoy the flavor of beef and vegetables, but if you get a chance to eat sukiyaki, please give it a try!\n\n*In Japan when you buy beef there is usually a bucket nearby where you can also take a cube of beef fat free of charge. If you want you can buy this separately, or you can use beef that has fat on it as well. \u25baPatreon: \n\n\u25baEQUIPMENT I use on my channel that you can buy online (Amazon affiliates links) \n\n\u2015Knife\u2015\nChef Knife: Sekimagoroku Gyuto  (\nDamascus Chef's Knife (\n\n\u2015Sharpening Stone\u2015\nKING Japanese Sharpening Stone 1000/6000 (\n\n\u2015Camera\u2015\nPanasonic GH5 (\nLens: LUMIX G LEICA (\n\n\u25baMain Channel: \n\u25baInstagram (\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf): \n\n\u3010Ingredients serves 3\u3011\n\uff0dUdon Noodles\uff0d\n300g flour \n140ml water \n15g salt\n\n\uff0dTempura (batter)\uff0d\n110g flour \n200ml (1 egg yolk + water combined) \n+ Any ingredients you want\nI used shredded carrots, eggplants, okra, and shrimp.\n\n\uff0dSoup\uff0d\n900ml water\n10g kombu \n20g dried Sardines \n20g thick bonito flakes\n5g thin bonito flakes\n\n\u25baMusic by Epidemic Sound \n\n  \u25baPatreon: \n\n\u25baEQUIPMENT I use in my channel you can buy online (Amazon affiliates links) \n\nYanagiba Knife: \n(This is different from mine but similar to the one I have)\n\nChef Knife: Sekimagoroku Gyuto  (\n\nDamascus Chef's Knife (\n\nCamera: Panasonic Lumix FZ-1000 (\n\n\n\u25baMain Channel (\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3): \n\u3000\n\u3000Instagram (\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf): \n\n\n\u3010Ingredients\u3011\n\nAny vegetables and fish you want! \n\n--Sauce--\n\n3 tbs Soy sauce\n1 tbsp Mirin\n2 tbsp Sugar\n150ml Bonito stock (Katsuo dashi)\n\n\n--Sakura tree (Ayashiraga)-- \n\nSomen noodles\n50g Rice flour \n100ml Water\n\n--Batter-- \n1 Egg yolk\n200ml Cold flour\n200ml Cold water\n\n70 % Canola oil \n30 % Sesame oil\n\nSesame oil is more expensive so you don\u2019t have to add any if you don\u2019t want to.

In fact, he got his start in the kitchen of a South Carolina Chick-fil-A. After years of chasing his dream of opening up a BBQ restaurant, Moss opened Buxton Hall in Asheville, NC.\r\n\r\n\"You can smell great barbecue long before you walk through the door.\r\nOutside Buxton Hall Barbecue, it\u2019s no different: The air hangs with the faintly smoky aroma of crispy pork. It only intensifies as you enter the brick-walled space, past T-shirts for sale (my favorite: SMOKED WHILE YOU SLEEP). In the open kitchen, pitmaster Elliott Moss stands over a whole pig, picking and chopping hunks of smoked meat. This is hog heaven.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re in the midst of a barbecue boom. Old-school joints are getting their due, and new-school smokehouses like Buxton Hall are proudly carrying on the tradition while shaking things up. Here barbecue means local pasture-raised pig (not the usual commodity stuff) smoked 18 hours over oak, cherry, and hickory. The pork is juicy and sweet and melts in your mouth. It\u2019s how Moss learned it from his grandfather growing up in Florence, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe egg-enriched buttermilk mixture makes for an especially crunchy and craggy coating. This recipe is from Buxton Hall, one of the Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.\"\r\n\r\n\"We want you to feel like you're at somebody's home, being taken care of really well.\" -Elliott Moss, pitmaster-owner, Buxton Hall.\r\n\r\n\"Good \u2019cue isn\u2019t the only thing that makes the experience. The fried chicken sandwich\u2014the meat smoked before it hits the fryer\u2014was the best version of that now ubiquitous dish I had all year. Mussels, which should have no business in a barbecue joint, were so good I sopped up the smoked tomato sauce with buttermilk hushpuppies.\r\n\r\nSides, so forgettable at other spots, are anything but. Green beans catch drippings beneath the pigs; collards swim with swine bits and cider vinegar; potatoes are smoked, mashed, and topped with hog gravy. A twist on the classics with one thing in common: the flavors of the pig. And that\u2019s what Buxton Hall is all about.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re living in the midst of a bona fide barbecue boom. Old-school joints are finally getting their due, and new-school smokehouses\u2014like Buxton Hall\u2014are proudly carrying on the tradition while shaking things up a little. Here barbecue means local pasture-raised pig (not the usual commodity stuff), smoked 18 hours over a mixture of oak, cherry, and hickory, until it's juicy and sweet\u2014just how chef Elliot Moss learned it from his grandfather in Florence, South Carolina. That said, whole-hog \u2019cue isn\u2019t the only thing going on in this gigantic dining hall. (If it appears to be the size of a roller rink, that's because it once was one.) The juicy fried chicken sandwich is topped with creamy white barbecue sauce and pimiento cheese and a slice of American cheese. Sides, often forgettable at other barbecue places, allow Moss to flex his creative muscles: green beans cook under the pig, catching all those fatty drippings; potatoes are smoked, then mashed and topped with hog gravy; braised collard greens are swimming with swine bits and a healthy spike of cider vinegar. All these twists on the classics have one thing in common\u2014the flavors of the pig. Ultimately, that's what Buxton Hall is all about.\"\r\n\r\nRead more here: \n\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon Appetit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba \r\n\r\nABOUT BON APP\u00c9TIT\r\nCook with confidence using Bon Appetit\u2019s kitchen tips, recipes, videos, and restaurant guides.

        "all_playlists_desc": "In partnership with Kenwood we cook up and share with you 3 versions of a similar dish or recipe... each one has been Made Better in some way to suit something very specific. Then we compare them... simple as that!      These videos will give you the best intro to what we're all about. Check them out and subscribe!     London is one of the best foodie cities in the world. In these videos, 3 of us pick what we deem London's Best *dish*... We eat them and then we argue about who's right!  The things we've always wanted to give a go... We have to create a dish designed for a celebrity and try to attract their attention on social media. Will they like it? When the two SORTED Chefs go head-to-head... sparks fly! Creating great food out of the safety and security of our own kitchen!  Food and cooking shouldn't be taken too seriously... here are a few of the silly games we get up to in the kitchen. You guys help to pick a theme... the 3 guys come up with their own version of a dish and compete to be crowned most ultimate... costumes help sometimes... apparently!?! There's too much good food in London... so we narrow down the choice of what and where to eat in the city regardless of your budget. Some awesome but cheap, something midrange and worthy of your custom and something a bit extravagant!  Over the years we have scrupulously tested kitchen gadgets of all shapes and sizes... and 2 of us are professionals... so you can *definitely* trust our judgement!    3 food-loving, but cooking-incompetent, idiots go head to head to head to create a dish to win over a chef judge. Sometimes, we even get our 2 chefs to battle it out against each other.   A whole week of BBQ recipes... and not a burnt burger or sausage in sight! Recipe videos including favourite dishes that we've made better for certain dietary requirements... a dairy-free or gluten-free or vegan or lean take on the classics!    If you eat food, then this is the show for you... but bigger and better! Welcome to the Common Senses Quiz!\n\nFour friends battle it out against each other, answering food based questions to work out who has the most common sense.\n\nEach episode focuses on a different sense, with its own ridiculous game to play.\n\nIf you're new to VR, make sure you check out this video. It will help you get the most out of your experience, no matter what equipment you've got:    A whole bunch of seasonal fun and food... looking back, it appears we always drank too much mulled wine before filming any of these! Sorry... and enjoy! If you eat food, then this is the show for you! All the videos from the SORTEDfood Summer holiday Out of the City!  All of the delicious recipes, created after Ben's trip to Japan, in one place!  More festive recipes than you can shake a festive sprig of holly at!    From time to time things get competitive in the SORTED kitchen... these are all of our Ultimate battles... who wins... you decide! In this series, Rennie send us an unusual or exotic ingredient in a Mystery Box and with your help we come up with something great to cook with it! #Spon ",
